When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms.

"Overall not a bad app. For the first week or so, it gave me notifications when it was supposed to, but after that, it's almost like it forgot sometimes itself, e.g. notification on Saturday when I set it for Friday. Reminders for things I have set daily don't even come up anymore, but it remembers to give me an display-over-app notification to remind me to set a reminder. Also, no push notifications that take you into the app so you'd have to do it yourself. Sub-tasks are my favourite feature!",Positive,4,0.59

"Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added.",Negative,2,0.46
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.,Positive,5,0.63

"This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions.

I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher",Neutral,3,0.47

"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.",Neutral,3,0.52

Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful.

Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade.

"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that.",Negative,2,0.45

It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us,Neutral,3,0.66

"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there.",Negative,2,0.53

Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.",Negative,2,0.51

Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review,Positive,4,0.83
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.",Positive,4,0.7
"This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do.",Positive,4,0.99

The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task.

"This is a great to-do list app. However, the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here. This app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free. Maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app. Right now, in the free version, you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets, but a reminder should be there even in the basic version.",Positive,4,0.5
"Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use.

"Realmente es una muy buena aplicación, es fácil ubicarte y organizarte si ya sabes usar este tipo de apps. Lo que encuentro mal es que hay opciones básicas como añadir notas a las tareas que están escritas, y por ellas hay que pagar. Me gustaría que no hubieran tantas opciones de pago o por lo menos no tan esenciales. De resto está muy bien esta aplicación.",Positive,4,0.68
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.",Positive,4,0.6
