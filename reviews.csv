I cannot open the app anymore
I have been begging for a refund from this app for over a month and nobody is replying me
Very costly for the premium version (approx Indian Rupees 910 per year). Better to download the premium version of this app from apkmos website and use it. Microsoft to do list app is far more better.
"Used to keep me organized, but all the 2020 UPDATES have made a mess of things !!! Y cudn't u leave well enuf alone ??? Guess ur techies feel the need to keep making changes to justify continuing to collect their salary !!! 🤤🤤🤤"

It has changed how I viewed my different lists. Now they are all jumbled together and I can't find what I need.
"I'm only looking for a grocery list app but every time I tap away from the app I have to tap again (after opening it again) to see the list. I can't find a way to keep a certain list showing when I open or reopen the app. eta: in response to the reply, it doesn't work like that on my phone. Even if the grocery list is showing, when I open another app and then go back to the any.do app, the list of lists is showing and I have to retap to get the grocery list to show again."
"Reset my free trial, new phone I'd like to see if it's better."
How do to stop monthly payment because i don't use this app anymore
"I complain about not crashes and it was immediately fixed!Good job!! Now the crashes have returned! I really need it fixed because I need to change apps otherwise 😩 I followed your instructions on deleting the data, etc but it just now crashed again. I am a patient person and I have used Any Do for years but let's try one more time and then I will have to find another app. It crashed again 😑"
"Constant crashing. After reading all the negative reviews, I Uninstalled it from all my devices. **Canceled subscription. App was great, until it crashed. After spending more than a hour setting it up on my Samsung tablet, it will not run. Cannot even get it to start. Too bad. In the past, my experiences have been good with this app. Guess I will see how long it takes to crash on my cell phone. So much for multi-device sync. Such a disappointment. **see above, for new comment added."
"Widgets are useless because they always show all tasks I have, regardless of category. There's no option to show only a specific category like groceries so they're all mixed up with to-do list tasks. Do developers even care about usability? Isn't it a software design 101?"
Horrible app. It doesn't do as described. Absolutely no support!
"Update October 2020: new update deleted all of my tasks, forced me to create an account, and now only bare minimum is free. Finding a new app. Been using this for years and loved it. With each update you get less and less free. It just auto updated and now I can't have reoccurring reminders without paying. Unless you count defaulting to every Monday. It wouldn't even allow me to update a long time weekly reminder"
Did not realize there was a charge for this app do not want this app.
"Spams notifications of how many tasks other users have completed this week. Who on earth would care? Uninstalled. **Update: Developer responded that this was a once off experiment. I think this was actually the third time I received this notification. Also, experimental spam is still spam"
Downloaded first thing it trys to do is do a con. Not impressed.
No longer works with Alexa. What happened??
it doesn't show any list
Do not download
This app is not what I wanted at all.
Unnecessary pop up. Really annoying and counterproductive
They recently started sending spammy notifications every week or so. Please stop.
"Shows tasks assigned to others in widget. A major missing feature for any serious projects, is some way to know if a task you're currently adding to a long list, already exists. Some kind of an automatic search through the existing tasks - at least the tasks in the current list - while typing in a new task. Other than that, this is great. Good job! _Task search in the web app is an extra step and not intuitive._ Using a separate search feature to check every new task you're adding, is absurd."
7 days for free and then you pay. Plus too complicated for some simple tasks
Update: thanks for your response. I would ask the developers to check their own app. There is NO monthly subscription option in the app. Old review: No monthly subscriptions? Why should I be forced to subscribe for a year? I am definitely not subscribing for a year in one go. This is ridiculously desperate.
Expensive paywall preventing access to features in wanting to try out
"I was about to pay for this app when I noticed a bug. It does not effectively sync tasks and events from the Google Calendar. Numerous issues, and you can't even mark those events as over. Sorry, not going to subscribe to this. I have no idea why this app is so famous. It's quite bad, in my opinion."
Worst application no task information on screen
"I downloaded this app to try for my task list but i see there're not many functions, choices of sounds, color labels... to make the task fun, dissapointed with the score i saw on Google Play. The worst point is this app forced me to pay for it without any awareness. I checked my Google play account before the trial end, i didn't see any Subscription plan from Any.do, but after the trial, it charged me yearly plan for this App. Bad way to trick people to pay for this app."
"Shameless App Ever, Waste Money !!! I have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year. Though no features of premium appeared. Can someone clarify the reason????"
I am not providing email addresses or google or Facebook accounts for a todo list
Uninstalled it as soon as it started sending me Ad notifications. Why does any developer think this is acceptable? Disgusting.
I have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year. Though no features of premium appeared. Can someone clarify the reason????
Have to pay premium if you want to put multiple reminders a day
"I have tried I installing this on two separate Android devices with no luck. I can not add my calendars. I put the widget on the home screen. It says I need to add my calendars and has a button to add them, but nothing happens when I tap the button."
Prayer Ubde
such a useless and greedy app only wants money as is chargeable after 7 days do you have shame i want to give you 0 star
Yes i what
Waste
"Really cumbersome, is not easy to use"
Was charged for the year instead of monthly
"Not free, cannot delete account"
Will not enable me to unsubscribe!
Dindigul
Latest update deleted all my tasks and lists! Have to start all over and try to remember what my list items were. I'll be looking for a new app.
Features for the free version are just disappointing.
Locking basic features behind a paywall is kinda weird
Soo awkward i can't able to sign *up* 😭 Sick app
Hangs when setting up Google Assistant
Subscription?? How does this application figure that it can be a subscription application? Ridiculous Update after developer response: This is not a subscription application. You are not Netflix or Adobe. This should be a standalone app quit trying to milk people's money. You can say anything you want. THIS WILL NEVER BE A SUBSCRIPTION APPLICATION. STOP BEING RIDICULOUS.
good
"Hopeless customer service. I paid for the premium version, had a problem with its sharing function, emailed customer support for a solution, was told it would take 2 business days for a response (which was hopeless enough), now over 5 business days later I've not received a response."
Duplicates files attached and you have to constantly delete. FIX THE BUGS.
Used to work so well earlier. Now it doesn't work at all!! Junk!!
Frustrating. Apparently its meant to sync grocery lists with Google home but doesn't. Absolutely no info on how to set it up
Too complicated to use
Forced sign in
Work on it
"I should have looked through ""most recent"" instead of ""most relevant"" reviews. It's far too limited for me in it's free state and I'm not interested in paying for a subscription just to unlock what should be basic functionality in a to do list app."
do not for showing or refund&refuse about my persional privacy.
"It doesn't have sub lists, e.g. ""child/school"", ""child/health"" so you see too many lists or too many tasks at once (which is overwelming)."
Not usefull and even they charge some money :)
This app is absolutely useless. Because of this i missed an important event because the reminder alarm supposedly forgot to rang. Its pathetic and useless.
Is the app or web platform down today? Can't seem to login either.
Have to pay for daily reminders... My phone does that free
The app is amazing - but the vibrations! So annoying!! Pls let me turn them off.
Dipak day Cox
Very bad
Location reminders don't work in medium power saving mode.. And all I got in reply was a copy paste solution and a trouble shoot link.
Fed up with interruption in each matter I note. Not worth the while HAVING there are far too many condescending workers out inte cyber world who refuse to take no for an answer.
"Really dissappointed in this app. Was using it to schedule my customers appointments. As soon as the new version came out, I lost everything. Going back to paper as at least my paper won't delete everything. A terrible app for business owners and scheduling appointments. Absolutely horrible and I'm very angry."
Thanks to your stupid update I lost ALL of my appointment dates... Terrible garbage.
"I miss Cal. The updates destroyed it, turned this into a cookie-cutter to-do app. It's a shame."
Was great but can't connect with other people since last update. Invite will go out and will even receive the invitation but doesn't link and have had no luck with customer support
I WAS TRYING FOR DAYS TO UN SUBSCRIBE. BUT OF COURSE THAT I was charged. Absolutely no support. Horrible and disgusting tactics
"Update ruined app Last update re-formatted the ""Plan My Day"" function so the ability to schedule tasks for that day or postpone into the future is unusable, so I have 50+ tasks and to way to arrange them into a comprehensive order. Contacted the developer who emailed me back after 4 days asking for a screenshot of the problem, so I sent it right back. 3 days later - no response from the developer, no fix, nothing. Update9/8: no fix, moved to aCalTasks +"
👎
"Does not do weekly reminders correctly. I opened a bug report, and was told that it was a known bug. A reminder app that gets reminders at the wrong time is a big 'no' from me."
"In app purchases significantly impact experience. £16 a year for features such as recurring tasks, you're having a laugh"
You need an account because they want to track your cookies for ads
Need to create an account to use it.
"Is NOTHING free anymore??. It looks like a good app but as soon as you open it, it gives the subscription rates 🤬🤬🤬🤬. I uninstalled immediately. Don't bother. Believe it or not, some people don't enjoy being nickle and dimed!"
Very bad
Pratz
i sent an ivite to people and everyone got over 50 emails for the one invite. What a joke of a an app.
I have to sync whatttt gtfohhhhhh
Bring back my money! Why your system stolen my money from pending subscribe? Without confirmation and notification!!!! Wheres my money???
WHY IS THIS SO BUGGY NOW? WHY ARE YOU NO LONGER REALLY BEING ATTENTIVE TO QUALITY CONTROL? CANT DELETE TASK ON ONE TRY. CAN NO LONGER DELETE FINISHED TASKS WITHOUT SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. ALL COMMANDS ARE HESITANT. ALL COMMANDS REQUIRE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. I HAVE EMAILED YOU 3 TIMES WITH NO RESPONSE. PLEASE ADVISE.

Makes simple things extremely complicated
Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.
The latest update now not working fine at all. It's worsening day by day. The developers now appears to have a different intention that premium paid version is purchased by the users.
Just use your basic phone calendar
I want to cancel the subscription.
MoneyGrabber Wants you to pay premium to choose specific dates.
Does not do much different than Google tasks (which is easier to use and is free). As a result I wanted a refund as I only realized this after my 7 day trial. Refunds are only given within 24 hours of their drawing their fee. Not sure that is legal for an automatic subscription after app trial.
"Bekaar... bagwas.. time waste... useless.. and asking for payment, before use anyway"
Useless app... Set up 8 reminders during a course of 4 days and not once received any notification! Waste of money.
Subscription!!!
"This app met my needs until this latest update. Dislike the new format to such a degree that it's a dealbreaker. Now I have to start from scratch researching apps to find a replacement. I know, I used the free version so you don't care if I go but this is such a disappointment."
It syncs EVERYTHING. terrible. you have to get the pro version in order to be able to do anything actually worth while!!!
I don't found usefulness
"In the calendar of Any.do, 1st of August is marked as bakr-Id, but 22nd August is not marked as Ganesha chaturthi! Is there a specific reason? or was it conveniently forgotten? Developer, please do respond. Because it depends on your response whether to buy it or not?"
Its a good app but the app keeps crashing when i allow this app to add to my calendar. After adding it to calendar then yhis app doesnt open. Keeps crashing
"Saying free and simple is not telling people it is a 7 day free trial especially at Google play store and people only know it's a 7 day free trial after they download it. So why won't Google do anything about this app developers not mention their apps have a trial period, which results in people downloading apps for nothing. PS 95% of the app is free, until the trial period finishes."
"Scam premium that bypasses GooglePlay, On the mobile app you can only buy 1 year of premium while on the website a monthly payment is possible. People buy the monthly more often and the developer listed it on its personal website only to bypass google fee, thus i need to link my card on their site too"
"This new layout is just awful. Just ridiculously awful. I cannot in any way fathom how this got a thumbs up from anybody. Bye bye Any.do, I'm off to download something that wasn't designed by a nine year old."
You have to open an account with them. I won't be going there. Would be nice to be given the choice.
"There is no option to delete the account. If i don't find this app useful, you guyz will keep my data? This is against the policies and norms"
Efvig
Sorry way to complicated. And why would you think I want my information out on your servers? Wanted to create a weekday event spent more time trying to figure out how to do that than it took to write in a diary.
Super
Worked great for a few years and then the past couple of months it eats anything added to the list! I can sit and watch things drop off before my very eyes!
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!!
Delete application
Laggy responses to resolved items and errors in recurring reminders
Nice app
No new it's repeated app
It stop working and I try to reinstall it but same problem
"Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled"
"I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model"
Atleast make a few features available .. if the customer donot like the app at initial stage than how would he/she ever think about going premium
"Requires a sign up for features I have no interest in using, but can't opt out of."
Did not sign up. App not even on my phone. This payment deduction will be reported and I request you refund my money immediately.
Autofill on Android 10 does not work
"Had charged twice but still not getting premium version access,"
Have have to make an account in order to use this app. There is no way around it.
"Creating an account is supposed to ALLOW you, not FORCE you. Uninstalled without trying it"
Stop Adding Groceries Items Like an Ad
Bakwas app
"I don't get task notifications anymore!!! This app has become useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, turned on / allowed notifications in the settings yet nothing."
Good improvements but still don't have nag or presisitent reminders. I missing a lot reminders accidentally
"Useless, ring bells only one time, and not a good reminder"
Having to pay to set a recurring task is ridiculous and essentially makes the app useless to anyone who doesn't want to pay so this essentially is not a free app.
There is some issue in payment.
Too complicated. I need a plan to plan tasks.
Everything it expects you to pay
"This app is useless unless you make the monthly payment, in that case does exist other app free and only with the essential"
Too many features locked behind premium.
Worst app
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on."
"OMG the UI is awful, seriously you have popup for premium every 2 seconds, there's no intuitive way see a normal calendar, you have to create an account even if you don't want to, the app is beautiful but show screen where it's impossible to understand what you have to do. It's a calendar, show a f... calendar."
Not good
"Trash. Yes, it has some nice nifty features but it lacks in complete necessities to actually plan your day. You can make a task, perfectly include subtasks and then add a nice color to the task. But no yellow, because that's already the fixed color of the 'priority label'. Reminders are great, except you can only have one. If I want to have a reminder on Wednesday 10AM and a reminder on Friday 6PM, I'd need a different app. Because this app only allows you to set 1 reminder. Frustrating. 0/10"
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later"""
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now
"While it's nice program, I can justify paying for it in perpetuity. That's just insane."
Have to pay for recurrent daily task.. which is the main purpose of that app.
"List sharing sharing is not working. UX is straight from iOS app, terrible"
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything."
Raben nat s7
First thing that happened upon opening is asking for payment. Good job.
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub."
"Unable to register with an email. Clicking""continue with email"" will just take you to a login page. Complete waste of time. I searched them first three pages of Google for a solution and found nothing. Found no solution on their help section. I don't want to register with Facebook or Google. If you include a feature, make sure it actually works."
"My backup is gone, very important data deleted"
"Any.Forget... Had an instance of daily repeating event, that I have marked as complete today and somehow it did skip the next day and only proceeded to the day after. Kind of ""daily event with some days skipped"". So useless to me as can't be trusted for notifying about daily routine tasks. P.S. don't tell me I don't know how to setup a recurring event!!"
"It works okay, But I did not consent to subscribing at $28/year subscription. I thought I purchased it until I saw that it was renewed for an additional $28. It's definitely not worth that price. Very angry and ripped off. I got charged twice for something that I thought I bought outright. I will never buy anything from them. Ever"
Very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app....
"Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked."
Anydo
"App loding ke baad peese maang raha hai, pahle bataaye , data kyo kharaab karwaya"
"Ruined the app by trying to get too fancy. My wife has also become frustrated with it. She has had it since it started and now struggles with it. You should be able to add a task then go straight to set time/day. But instead, you have all the other short cuts there that really aren't."
I could not have any expirions about this app
Terrible App. Don't waste your money.
I couldn't use it
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.
"Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled."
Hf
Most useless app ever used! Very difficult to save anything or find anything! Put some tasks didn't get any reminders so didn't do it! Erasing this nonsense Can't even save this review
Its a great app but I dont receive any events notification although I have allowed the notification to come through from this app. I really don't understand why because I have set everything correctly.
Virender.kumar
Useless
Price is high
"Under subtitle *security* ""However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers"" Sorry no thanks.i just downloaded but after reading privacy policy i prefer going thru •Google official •one & app like calendar required lot of access ,&i personally don't wanna bleach my data like this..btw the tq for placing the info it to let us know :)"
Bad app
Tried doing all the settings as per ur guidence.. but app is not supporting popups in lock screen.. everytime I have to unlock my screen to check the event..
"This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance. No i don't need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order I entered each item. I do not need an any.do minute."
KimHong
I hate this app 😡😤😤 as soon as I downloaded it my phone was hanging 😠😠😠😡😠😡 😠
"Monthly fee for Dark mode, really? I could accept a one time payment for such a feature but not monthly."
"No Grocery widget, Ridiculous... The task widget is confusing, I just want to be able to add stuff simply on the fly."
This app has Malware.
"Not happy, app just asked me to 'sign in' and now has deleted all my previous reminders. I had reminders set up for throughout the rest of this year and now I don't know what they were. You've put me off using your app now, what's the point if it's not reliable!!!"
Not Making an Account!
"I was a customer of Any.Do for a while and on March 2020 i clearly asked them NOT to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services - Todoist. More than that - i even consult with Any.Do technical support team how to transfer my database to Todoist and over the phone, i ALSO remind them to cancel it. I received the cancellation notice and I DID NOT ask them to renew/continue any of Any.Do services. More than that - i also have the Invoice from the company i moved my services, Todoist, for the same period of time that Any.Do charged me for. After i tried to contact Any.Do they refused to refund me. Therefore, i let you and everybody to know that I WILL NOT USE ANY OF ANY.DO services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post DO NOT USE ANY.DO SERVICES or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well."
"EVERY service I attempted to connect (Gmail, Gtasks, google calendar,) timed out during setup (oops error). Been 2 days and still no reply from support. Device is Samsung S9 with Android 10."
"This app used to be great when paired with Alexa. Every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue. This has not been the case for the past several months. Any.do it is no longer syncing with Alexa and based on the reviews of the Alexa app it is affecting a lot of people, has been ongoing for weeks, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming. Going to give anylist a try to see if it works with Alexa."
I dont know..why people appreciate this app..not user friendly...
Time setting is so dumb. Fix it
SWEETY SWEETY Kumari
Not working
No integration with created Alexa Lists.
You have to pay for all the decent features... There's nothing you want to do that your alarm doesn't already do
can't open
Hopeless
I dont understand how it works. Not very clear on how to use it. And it comstantly showed notifications for anything i made a note of
Do not have option to not connect to fb google or email
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice."
Please Add UPI feature because I tried many debit cards to get the Premium Versionof this app but any of them was accepted.
Lost all my lists when I was forced to give email address. Was good prior to having to start all over.
"Many errors, the app is good but sometimes with the recurrent task do not work when I use desktop app it do not sync well and I lose many task and this is unpleasant. Pay for this app with this errors is a bad idea. I do no feel secure with app I lose taks and time. I hope the app get better. And the plan my day would be good if add the tasks in someday"
"Since last 2 updates I am facing this problem that when I open the app, one or two tasks get shuffled to the top. Then I have to put it again in the planned sequence. This happens almost everytime I open the app."
"Updates made it worse. Was using it all the time, and the recent updates made it all confusing and unnecessarily graphically complex. Sorry had to uninstall."
Rare
Good app but I wish there was a monthly payment option for premium instead of annual.
Pushing to hard for premium upgrade. Not interested anymore
"Ill join with my fellow reviewers and say that i was very satisfied with the app when i started using it about two years ago, but since then i feel that its functionality and simplicity have been compromised, especially with the newest update that just made the app's interface (via smartphone) completely uncomfortable because i can't see my tasks laid out chronologically in an organized and pleasing way anymore."
Whapp integration is bad. Barely anything works. Focus to whapp integration and seeya again
"It was good until they updated it and took out the today, someday, upcoming categories out, which is how I organized everything"
"I found this app difficult to organize in a way that was useful for me. I couldn't separate which items showed up on my phone widget by topic, so it showed all of them which was unnecessary. I also found the reminders to plan my day annoying. It would be better with an improved calendar and prioritizing options. Last, it is extremely frustrating to try and unsubscribe from yearly renewal. It is buried deep in the info and the actual faq for this has a broken link. Super sketchy and rude."
"Widget not working. Everytime i checked the next or previous month it'd be lagging and later it was just blank. Love the app but i really need the widget, sorry."
no repeat alarm
"Why are random items popping up on our Grocery List? Is this your way of advertising? We have purchased unnecessary items that I had never even heard of. Sun Maid Smore Bites? Nope, no one added them on. I love using the app, but this is very deceptive manipulating the grocery lists."
"I switched to Any.do when Wunderlist ended. I wanted a simple interface that let me share lists and tasks with my husband. Any.do did that, but in the least efficient way possible. Our initials are the same and tiles aren't customizable, so it was impossible to tell who a task was assigned to. The app always defaulted to tasks even if I had just been using a shopping list. It was a huge pain to navigate. Not what we needed at all."
Confused
I like this apps but the thing is anything need to pay? So sorry to do list i only gave it 2 star and its so bad 😔
Star
"The app used to be great, now it's intrusive. I can't get it to stop popping up and inserting itself into my life. Uninstall."
"Google login not working at all. Tried 2 accounts, gets stuck at setting up"
"With the recent upgrade, the phone app arbitrarily deletes things off my to do list or moves them around without me doing it. The app on my desktop is now slower than molasses. It worked great until the upgrade!"
"Tarefas (Tasks) somem sozinhas e atrasam nos horários em demais semanas pré-definidas. A ideia do aplicativo é boa mas esses problemas o torna praticamente inútil, inviável utilização."
Its ok i guess
"The app was great until I suddenly lost all my data. I went to launch it after closing it 30 minutes ago, and everything was gone. I had so many tasks and notes in it"
"App shouldn't enforce sign in for use. Uninstalled. Waste of time. Edit: that sounds like optional functionality for an app labeled to do list! Not a complete blocker to using the app. For a simple ""I need to make a quick note to remind myself of later"" this isn't very good."
Not what is expected
"Useful app, but it just beeped/popped up a notification advertising some new features. I consider that spam, that's why you're getting the 2 stars."
"First day of downloading it, it drained my battery in 6h (both phone and watch). Battery went back to normal once i uninstalled it. Please fix that guys so we can use the app"
Perhaps the least user friendly app on Playstore. My head is spinning. Why is it so hard to edit the time of reminder?
The last update removed grid view and left us with a very odd task interface.
This is not free. Paid one. Some features are limited till paid.
"Upon making a task, setting time and date by typing them has become absurd! The app understands what it wants and acts by itself. What do you mean 'use natural language'?"
"Update on 25/8/20 :- worst update ever,, was moderately ok until August update. app totally dewastated. Now it is even lags like hell. Not even able to strike down a task after doing it in one touch 👎👎👎"
App is good & I am using it since 6 months now BUT NOW A DAYS AUTOMATICALLY SHUTDOWN WHOLE WORKING
Got into the help menu by accident. Can't get back to my lists.
"I used this app every day for years, but just uninstalled and changed to a different to do list app because of the new layout. The grid was much easier to use and better looking."
I have bought it yet it displays ERROR IN VERIFYING MY WHATSAPP INTEGRATION 😡😡😡😡
"A lot of basic features locked away behind a pay wall, not very customisable imo . Not the right to-do list app for me."
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one
"It duplicates events, often with the incorrect time, and delete events I invite other to. Very aggravating."
Constant prompts for trials and upgrades. Super annoying.
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app."
"Beautifully designed interface, but VERY CLICK-BAITY / PUSHY - I would NOT recommend."
"Bare Bones. Integrations are a lie. You have to use a third party app to make it work and Zapier is garbage. Grocery list is kind of cool. Calendar has that annoying Apple style slide that hides evens and is impossible to read instead of traditional blocks. Support button is for bug fixes only, so premium support is also a lie."
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?
Rimnder alram ka bhi option h ya nhi
Loved this app but I prefer writing things down
Ordinary updates delete reminders
Why pay for such simplicity?
"For an app that's meant to help me organise my time more effectively, I didn't expect it would take the longest time to boot up compared to all the utility apps on my device... Really nice UI though..."
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?
"I like it at lot, but it seems like recently, this v thing is taking out my battery, hogging memory, and using data more than chrome which I use constantly. Until someone can help me figure this out, or if this high usage of phone resources is normal, I can't rate it any higher. I might even have to remove it and search for an alternative."
Can't repeat task at custom intervals
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!
"Uninstalled. I want a simple reminder app that will put a daily notification in my notification bar, every single day. Nothing else. No other features. But this is so bloated with features, it's impossible to know if it might do this or not."
"Couldn't get the hang of it, I want something simple and cheaper to remind me of birthdays and dog to vets etc"
"Too annoying premium advertising, darkmode is premium only"
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features."
Used to be good but now doesn't even notify me (and yes this is with the settings amended accordingly)
"Some of the sentences on my lists go off the screen, so we need an option to wrap the text when it reaches the right side of the screen. As of June 4, 2017, I can not sign on anymore using samsung galaxy after upgrading to Android 7.0 software. As of 6-19-2020, I never did get any.do to work on my Samsung galaxy s7, but it now works on my Samsung note 8."
"You better don't rotate your phone from vertical to horizontal when typing new task, because it will be GONE. Any.Do support team said 2 years ago that it will be fixed, but it's still not. Also I have over 80 tasks and would love to see the search feature and ability to sort tasks by the date of their creation and by the alert date. The search was implemented but I don't know how to use it. Probably it works only on paid version."
i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but it's expensive soo.. k bye
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.
LAGGIN! cannot open. Tq
Recurring reminders are available for free in Google reminder. You can't Monetize the basic functions.
For me it frequently stops syncing. I currently can't get it working again. But when it was working it was great.
Doesnt work on windows
not user friendly.
Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time. Will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue. Or at least give the option to turn it off.
"The website boasts that any.do is the best grocery list app for Android Wear. Lies. There is no way to view lists on Android Wear, only add tasks. You can view lists on Apple Watch. This is the feature I need and I guess I'll look elsewhere."
"Reminder does not pop up on time or in some cases, does not pop up at all"
I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.
"Not the bloody annoying calendar/task widget thing again. You did this once before. I don't want to use your calendar, just the task list so please bring back the option of a widget without the calendar option written at the top. Will use an alternative until I see AnyDo has been updated."
"Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed"
Not yet solved. Cannot log in
"I need this app to share tasks real time with my significant other. Unfortunately, when she is adding tasks from iOS, sometimes they do no show up for me. Switching to Microsoft To Do and no problems. Additionally, being able to paste multiple cells from Excel makes MS offering indispensable, something I would sorely miss if I returned to Any.do."
useless
It can't adjust tasks with real-time line.
I actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that I need to edit my review due to the changes...
"In a word: clunky. I like the calendar integration, however everything else is basic and clunky. Simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you CANNOT SET A DATE, TIME, SUBTASKS, OR NOTES UNLESS YOU EXIT OUT OF THE TASK AND GOING BACK TO YOUR LIST. The app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version. And whatever you do, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR SEARCHING FOR HOW TO DO SO."
"Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope"
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess."
Free version is very limited compared to Ticktick and Microsoft To Do.
"I've enjoyed using this app since I got it two weeks ago until recently, when it began crashing when I'd add tasks."
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this."
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff
a mess of features that don't serve me; cumbersome UX
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C."
I have cancelled my subscription. An amount of Rs. 909.90 has been deducted from my account. Kindly refund the same. I'm not interested in the app
"This app always put the things I haven't done to the next day. I don't like this. It should be stay at there if I didn't finished the work nor help me move to the next day and ask me to do it! If I didn't finished it, I'll continue the work tomorrow. I don't need you to help me move the task to the next day. It's annoying"
"Lost another star for your reply to my previous comment. I like the ""moment"" notification. I like planning my day.. i hate the dumb sounds I can't turn off for every item I snooze."
"I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark"
Not free
"You can' t manage it easily per day, the interface is not clear when i click on a day I want to say only that day agenda not others around it. When i add a task it doesn t show me in which day is added - i have at least ten ideas to improve. They contact me, i will uninstall it for now. I submitted few complaints but there are more"
Important features locked behind a pay wall.
A suspicious app! Do not recommend this application.
"Poor widget options, which is what I needed most. Very space inefficient and not customizable at all. Disappointing. Todoist had the most compact and useful widget, followed by Microsoft ToDo."
Keep losing mini steps after I write them down.
"Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view."
Estou tendo dificuldades com alguns bugs..
There is a issue with Notes. For as long as I can remeber you sometimes add a note and it's gone later. I keep having to go out and come back each time I add one in hope it's saved.
I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.
"Doesn't show empty hours like Gcalender, also asking me to subscribe from the get go."
"We dont use it. Like at all. Its not that different from your regular phone calendar. I'd actually like a refund, didn't even realize I was charged."
Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.
There are certain things I love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically. But overall this app stresses me out. I just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list. But the grocery list seems buried in an area that isn't intuitive. I don't need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim.
You reaaallllyyy don't have a lot without paying
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.
"The design is nice but it doesn't understand when I said 'later'. When I said remind me tomorrow morning, it replied okay I'll be reminded tomorrow at 16:00+. That's afternoon. I'll be very well roasted by my boss by then. Can't find any help on these issues. Was close to confirming my subscription. Sad ☹️"
Premium version only
"Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me."
"Trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what I set it as. Trying to change the date back just creates a second event. Then trying to delete both events takes several tries, because half the time they don't actually delete. This is really annoying."
Weak and underdeveloped platform. Don't expect support to treat you like a person - this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you.
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
Missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items!!!
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!"
Nested can be improved
It's a fine app but logs me out every other time I go to use it.
"Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ"
Recurring tasks are behind a pay wall. Ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature App is a little ugly and not customisable.
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.
Strange thing. When I mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the Upcoming section.
Notification is now pathetic.. shame. I liked it a lot. I think its time to jump ship. It's been fun.
After all this time you still can not search tasks on Android. So you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for. Going down to 2 star.
Not free
"muito limitador pra quem não paga pra usa, e nem é tão vom assim."
"It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks."
"Слишком сложно, но при этом нет того, что нужно. Очень много возможностей, но не смог элементарно сделать TODO список на _каждый_ день. И постоянно лезут с предложением купить премиум. Да не вопрос, если бы был необходимый функционал. Ощущение, что приложение разработано рубить бабло, но при этом не задумываясь о потребностях пользователя."
No monthly recurring reminder features. Can't even remind me when to pay the bills!
Have to create an account just to check out functionality. Don't want to do that. Uninstalling.
How do i unsubscribe this useless app?
"List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!"
Update: Used to be great. Now they've added so many steps it's no longer the simple app it used to be. Very disappointed.
"I can t select weekly days which days i need remainder, and this drawback of app, best to go with other app"
Uninstalled after latest update and it blocked all my lists until I set up an account. No thanks.
"The ""not completed"" tasks do not carry over to the next day automatically. I wanted an app that would constantly flash incomplete tasks in my home screen. Otherwise, presentation of the app is good."
"Very average app, not intuitive . Will probably spend more time trying to plan than doing"
I dont liek it rlly
Premium version is too much expensive. Any.do should provide an option in which we can select max. 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version & pay accordingly.
"Looks really good but... I'm not going to pay a subscription for it, sorry. If you said one off payment then maybe. Most of the locked features are available in other products out there."
Well designed and all however alot of the crutial features are locked behind the premium which u need to pay for
Unable to edit time for reminder. S7
Cant really set custom remindere. For example I need to be able to check a specific system every 3 hours with other variables.. Cant do it
"Could have been a good free app. Nice design , good ideas but the free version keeps forgetting the task alarm I configured. I put it at 6 but it resets it at 9. Don't know about the paid one."
"Hi there, i would like to know if this application is for free or do i need to pay for it? Thank you for your answer."
"Day 2 of trialling this. So far I've had two location reminders fail, I can't label a location with more than one letter, the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so I don't know what it sounds like, not that I can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work. I had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours. How is that a typical snooze length? Adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive"
I want to discontinue and it was monthly base they charge me yearly it's very sad pls help and refund
"It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar… not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!"
"I love this app, but recently the app keeps crashing everytime I enter. Plus the calendar is completely wrong. 😕"
No dark theme without a premium subscription? Ok
"It's very simple, and it's interface is so beautiful. Why did I put 2 stars then? Because most of it features are limited to the paid edition, even the important ones."
Looks like a copy of an IPhone app. Im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui. A night mode should come standard
There is no sound
"Too much spam. Stuff that I don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders I wanted the app for. Also, too many emails. I don't want more clutter to ""organize"" my life."
Very productive
I dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service
Not a great user interface. Have been using for almost 2 months but still struggling
Hate subscription uninstalled
Does this app work without internet connection also?
gaada waktu kapan harus selesai.. jadi kurang detail
Over all good task manager. But I do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with MS outlook. It is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited. Not possible to sync task between this 2apps.
"Sharing didn't work, there's a permanent notification and everything is premium option, even the theme!"
"I was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs. Seemed ok, with limited use so far. The only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and Any.Do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day. I don't need it taking over things, i will plan when i want. Are you seriously doing this? It is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying."
"Syncing with Alexa takes over 10-15 minutes which renders it unusable. Any.do, before you post your generic response: yes, I added the skill to my Alexa and, yes, I logged into my accounts. It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars."
"I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it."
Good until it started wanting money for doing its job
"Pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once I've gone back to a long list I created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version, so annoying. Don't need the song and dance this app offers if it can't save a basic list"
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys."
"Wear OS app only supports adding tasks, not viewing existing ones (without reminders)"
"I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find."
Downloads the app but package file is invalid error pops up before completing installation
"It's very confusing. I got the calendar app that was suggested to me when I wanted to use the widget, but once I started using the calendar along with any.do the tasks notifications got duplicated. I don't see the point of having any.do when the calendar app does the same thing."
So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.
"Ah yes, wanna use an ""advanced"" calendar? Well, turns out you must have an account for that. What's that, your eyes are burning under this bright theme? Well we have a solution just for you! As you have seen in our tips, you can change the theme. Oh W O P S, NO YOU CAN'T, how silly of us to not tell you in tips that ~BUY OUR PREMIUM!!!~... //Maybe it's just not what I was looking for..."
"Too whacked for creating lists, like grocery or to do with their tasks and subtasks instead of just lists you can check complete"
"I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports"
There should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option
"I liked using this app but I recently noticed that important information I had saved in sub tasks has all been deleted. Its happened before and I thought I had made a mistake. But no, it's just this app malfunctioning."
Many times I've put sub tasks on my to-do tasks and they just disappear for some reason. I've forgotten many things because of this and still hasn't been fixed despite various updates.
App not bad but very limited unless you pay. Downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's WhatsApp integration. That is only available if you pay. Without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app.
"I am a paid user of this app. I like this app a lot, until Android 10. They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day. So it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between. Not cool. 👎"
"I dont like that it requires you to login, why cant I just use it without logging in my accounts"
Questionable experience. Upgraded to premium but WhatsApp integration is not working. Seems a little confusing.
Zero features in free version.
"good shared tasks, but app itself makes me angry.. it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account.. so I need to login for like each two weeks or so.. and it also forgets my settings... Edit: unfortunately this has not been fixed yet, even though I had sent logs and communicated with you. Decreasing my rating."
I can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watch...ugh.
"when you switch the language, you get wierd bug that your app is half in English half in selected language"
I was given this premium app. Now with new versions is not updating. I fail to understand this. If I'm given premium version then now why wouldn't it get updated? If it was non upgradable then why was it given? It's a great app and so it hurts when there are such tricks used on customers.
"Dec. 5, 2019 Update Moved from 5 stars to 2 for the reason below: I've had this app for about half a decade. The last couple years have been irritating. I add sub tasks. When I go back to the tasks, the sub tasks aren't there. I wish there was a save button as a cue and confirmion that the subtasks are saved. Not sure how long I could forgive the app until I just use another one altogether. Please address subtasks staying in the next update. Thanks! Was 5 stars for the longest time Awesome!"
"Useful as a to-do list. Sets a real annoying ""plan your day"" popup reminder every morning. How you disable it is non obvious. Uninstalled."
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"
Reminder feature is not working 🥱
"Allowed all the permissions for this app but i still can't get the reminder to work on my smartphone running Android 8. Downloaded a different reminder app and also allowed all permissions for it, and it worked well."
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.
I used to love it. It was my go to app for many years. But over the time it is losing the special status. It doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times. They removed that!
"The alarm feature does not work, which leads to missing the tasks."
"Nice looking UI, but inability to disable popups is a deal breaker for me. Uninstalled."
"This still works pretty well, but I'm not a fan of the updated widget not listing tasks chronologically."
Good app. Annoying pop up every morning on my phone even though I have the notification turned off.
I haven't used they made an effort from there side. I'm a bit of a mess and I need time.
"29.9. Nothing new, I've already reconciled to that ""improved"" GUI. // 16.7.20, 3.8.19: No, a long time ago I was able to create a FULL (WITH a reminder) task in a LANDSCAPE mode. It's impossible now (after that 'redesign'). // 17.7., 2.3.: I'm pretty sure I WAS ABLE to create/edit a new task in ONE go (and in LANDSCAPE). It takes MORE moves now. // 2.2.2019: I CANNOT believe that when I HAVE got to change a grip from PORTAIT to LANDSCAPE when creating / editing a task it is more effective than before..."
"I've been a satisfied user of Any.do since March 2018 and my subscription is until 2021. However, when I tried to create a recurring event, it kept directing me to the subscription page much to my disappointment."
"Some features just don't work in the free app! I have tried to set a daily reminder for 9am to put a ticket in my car. Once I click ""Done"", it sets the reminder the next day.... at 1am. I dismissed the 1am reminder once, half asleep as the sound woke me up, it never reminded me again and now I have a parking fine to pay. I have real memory difficulties and need an app that actually works properly! Disappointing, as I find the one off reminders really helpful."
I am not sure who want to pay monthly fee for a to-do list app. One time payment always make a sense.
"Started out strong... First few days perfect, synced to smart watch and woke with everything planned. But now it's not sending the notifications regularly - not to watch or android phone. Added it to the PC and tried the phone widget - maybe that broke it. Weird pile of repeated completed daily tasks with no time set, while the daily tasks with times don't notify. Some work then don't - very frustrating. Clearing the cache/reinstall didn't work. Feels like a battle to get it to function. :/"
Features are all right. It doesn't seem to me like they actually USE their own product. Else the idiosyncrasies would have been ironed out.
Didn't like
"Now able to see list view from widget thanks to developer response - but there's a new bigger problem now. The integration with Google Assistant is going terribly. Everytime I try to add an item to my grocery list through Google Assistant, Any.do creates a new list called ""Grocery"". When I ask what's on my grocery list, it replies ""you have 3 lists named Grocery, which would you like?"""
It was awesome at first. Then I try to add an event from the widget and it won't do it correctly. Super frustrated
"Nuisance app. It probably works fine, but it's definitely not for me. However, when I decided to uninstall it, it gave me no easy way to delete my account. To delete my account I need to enter a password. I never set a password because I signed up with Google. So I have to login to create a password just to enter password to delete the account. I haven't figured out how to revoke the permissions I gave. This is abusive. Deleting an account and data should be straightforward."
"Love this app, but some functions make the productivity lacking. In my experience, there is a limited amount of notifications I can receive from this app per day. There appears to be no way to change this on the settings for my phone or the app. This is problematic for me, because I have the premium version and have it connected to Zapier. I am not receiving push notifications when actions are taking place. Very disappointing, as this is crucial for time management projects with teams."
"The Next 7 Days is No Longer Showing ""the next 7 days"" but rather group by lists and not by days.."
"I have used this app for years, it is great if you want to be more organized and get reminders of the tasks you need to do. I must say however, that the app itself has regressed throughout the years with all the updates. Things used to be simple and intuitive, now I don't understand what half the buttons do, basic functions like deleting and removing tasks are way too clunky. The concept of the app is great but I can't recommend it anymore, each update makes it worse."
"It's a good app! It reminds me of things I tend to forget, don't get me wrong. It's good just that I don't like the layout that came wirh the recent update. Everything is cluttered now, before things were organized, what happened?"
"99% premium advertising, free version is not usable"
I pay for the premium app and it keeps closing down on me once Im in the app. What can I do to keep that from happening?
"Just enough features to be useful yet simple and (mostly) uncluttered. Been using the app for years. The new rocket animation showing total tasks completed, and congratulating me for the most mundane thing is extremely irritating though, and lost the app a star."
Almost perfect app just one thing I wish anydo had is hourly reminders and copy reminders to set the same task just a different time... This is coming from a PAID subscriber...
What happened to the missed calls notification? I recently switched phones and had to download the new version and the option is no longer there. It was one of the main reasons I used the app.
"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes. The reason for this is that I hate apps that scream ""pay me money"" since the instance you download it, and this one did that exactly. With the ""free premium trial"" being in your face all the time, and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is ""premium"". Just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it. It looks amazing though."
Love it. Great future.👪🙌
So nice
fantastic
Too many options and gets too fancy for an app that should just have simple functionality to setup reminders and to do items
"Good app but needs ability to customize recurring events by allowing us to input an end date.. i.e can't end a private lesson series after 8 lessons, it reoccurs forever."
"La baje para sincronizarla con Whatsapp y esa función es paga, por lo demás no la probé."
Way too expensive; if there was a monthly option I may consider going premium.
"Expirencing some problems with the reminder sometimes it sounds, sometimes it doesnt, help please"
Great UI an reminder app. Only downside is I cant mute notifications for certain accounts which is really annoying. I'd like to see my events but not have notifications for them as I have a ton.
Just not for me. They also seem to refuse to let you delete your account by refusing a password that was created 15 seconds. Lots of cool features but not what I'm looking for.
"Perderam integração com a Alexa? Ao selecionar a opção no Any.do, sou direcionado para o app Amazon Alexa e lá aparece a mensagem de erro que essa skill não existe mais."
Reporting abuse.
good
I like it true
"App is fantastic. However, when a task reminder pops up, it disappears without acknowledging the notification. It used to have an icon at the top left but it does not show up anymore. Not sure if it is a big in the latest update. Please fix. I am on a OnePlus 7 pro running the latest OS."
Hyyy
Any Do Moments are not working for me.. 😪 Please look into it.
"1) When i access from pc it shows different calander google account. And when i access from phone it shows different google account (i use 4 different gmail accounts) 2) also when a task is completed or deleted from the app, without touching the notification bar on phone, notification on phone stays. It has to be swiped away manually. So i have to use two actions to delete one tasks. Edit-1 Now the app sticks and has become slow after the recent update. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling. still no success. it"
Don't know
"I can't set my time the same time I write up a task. I always have to save then revisit and set the time, which is very annoying. Also I can't upgrade to the premium version which is very disappointing. Overall not a bad app but there are a few things that need to be tweaked"
It went from simple and useful to cool and confusing this morning. I don't know what is going on. I'm disturbed
"Great features, ability to collaborate, and plenty of options. I just wish the interface was designed by a human being, it's the most cluttered and hard to navigate todo list app by far. Compare it to Google Tasks for example: You just open the app and start typing, and everything you need is right there, with easily discoverable features. This app constantly had me frustrated and searching around for what I wanted to do. UI in general looks like a high schooler with a UI hobby made it. Basic af"
We need a monthly payment terms. Currently it is yearly only!!
"I absolutely loved this app, but for the last week or so I cannot scroll through the calendar function without it scrolling itself back up to the previous week. Horrendously annoying. If you could fix this that would be awesome as otherwise I would have given 5 stars..."
mobile app isn't very intuitive but the desktop app is good
"I like the app overall, but there are bugs that need fixed. The app keeps stopping. Also, pay and buy need a recurring option."
"All around amazing life improver with one irritating caveat. The reordering functionality could really use some work. Often the reordering fails and the task gets thrown out of ""Today"" into ""Someday"" which means I have to go fish it out from a long list. Sometimes this will happen multiple times in a row really testing my patience. Been dealing with it for many months now - want to continue using this awesome app but really struggling with this one bug. Galaxy S9+, Android 10, One UI 2.1"
"Beautiful interface but it is very annoying to navigate and not fluid. Creating reoccurring tasks seems to be a pain. Not sure if it's me or the app, but I kept having to change the time 2-3 times to get the correct times reoccurence. Grocery list is awesome. The calendar looks like Google calendar which is nice but it is choppy to navigate."
The day ended and i didnt end my task and it didnt shift or alarm about undone tasks
It's not what i need
It had a peculiar issue.. I have set it up to remind me of my ask with on screen notification but often it fails to do so and then I miss the task.
This is so frustrating!!! I set a event for someone's birthday then a event a month ago before the birthday to not forget to buy the stuff they want and nothing shows up! Nvm it shows up on my Google calendar
Don't have a monthly plan. I can't find it in the premium section
"I like the functions, wish the support was better."
Well I have suggestion make a system where students could track time... Like total available time then distribute it over task..
Not pleased
I love the widget but whenever I edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and it's extremely annoying
How to get the pop up for missing call alerts
"The latest app update (7/26/20), ""new app navigation..."" is a definite downgrade, from panes to a one side scroll, now I can no longer see full task list names, the ""all tasks"" option is changed, the new layout sucks. Why do developers always do this, ""fix"" things that aren't broken? Why can't you just improve the things people are requesting, instead of changing everything else around too? This ver is much harder/inconvenient to navigate than the previous one was. Trying to revert to older."
Don't like the app and trying to unsubscribe but there is no option
Can't import/sync w/ Google Tasks?
The daily reminder does not work i mean it works on the first day but than on the next day it does not make sounds or pop up when its to do the task
"While it sure has its benefits, there's still a lot to be desired."
Problem with the notification. Can't complete task from notification. Keep showing till I mark task as finished that too by opening the app.
Sir i have deleted this app i cant understand how to do so that the reason please reset my google account from any do and donot charge after 7 day trial
"Extremely aggressive in pushing the premium and paid version. Also overly complex since as its name denotes, it tries to do everything or anything. It may be beneficial to consolidate and duplicate tasks of several other apps even though some can perform better. Compare the shopping list in Google Keep which is easier to add or subtract items from a constant shopping list. This app combining tasks from other apps can be useful, depending on an individual's preferences and abilities."
Literally half the features under premium can be found free with other apps.
It's ok
How to connect with Yahoo mail
Needs smart dictation like todoist and better calendar widgets like ticktick
Needs work. Time options in Custom ARE NOT Professional enough.
Can't move it to SD card. I need space on my phone so I'll likely be deleting it.
Review more for 5 stars!
I paid for premium account. But my account status is still free with no premium feature.
I really want to like this app. We use it to share shopping lists. But the syncing with my wife's phone leaves much to be desired.
I am on premium and i don't receive whatsapp messages as reminders
Add features like todoist
"I like the app but the only thing which i personally wanted was, if i were able to share picture with my shared tasks people, lets say i make a task to pay bill with my husband but i want to send him the image of the bill. Other than that better from other apps"
"I have used this for a while and, though it isn't a perfect fit, it does a great job of allowing me to schedule alarms for tasks and easy snoozing of those alarms. But they updated and fixed what wasn't broken. Now, all uncompleted tasks show in the task window with no delineation of whether they are recent, scheduled, or past due. Visually, it is very confusing. I'm probably going to dump this app. I would like a good calendar view of things scheduled on each day and it doesn't have that."
Ok
You have to pay to get half the features
Very limited without premium
"When you put something in a category and then rename it, you have to re-categorise. Not amazing at sharing - list items get out of sync on multiple devices."
"It's got promise, just not there yet. To many glitches to justify the premium version. Small things here an there but the main problem is events consistently erase information and become in unable to edit. Now you have permanent events stuck in your calendar that cannot be changed. For the free version I guess you could put up with it but it's still annoying. It's got style and potential. One day I hope to be back and check it out again."
Best GUI with few bugs
I left a review earlier that was one star. While the app wasn't for me (I found that it was confusing and didn't suit my needs so I deleted it shortly after) The customer service was fantastic. I was charged for a subscription even though I didn't use the app because I made a mistake in canceling the subscription. I sent an email detailing my problem and asking for a refund. The response was quick and a refund was granted I thought it was only fair to come back and leave a nicer review.
I just downloaded the app not quite long. I've started to enjoy it but there's one problem. The widget is usually empty even though there are tasks in the app. What can I do about it?
برنامه عالیه اما اکثر امکاناتش پولیه
Nice
Very handy if you're going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase. Easy to use and plenty of features.
"I have such extensive ideas for productivity apps that a developer should retain me as a consultant before the competition gets me. None are even close to my standards, yet. One general idea for free: if a customization option that any one to-do list app has is useful, why don't they all have it?"
"App was excellent till recent, but I'm unable to add new task after recent updates."
I really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me.
"This is a simple free app. With an easy to use features and interface. But not much to explore, limited, with only the premium features as something that might pique your interest on. Other than those, this app does what it says on the description. If you're interested in a straight-to-the-point checklist, with minimal features, I think this can be your go to app. (3 stars; since this is not what I, personally, would look for in a to do app)"
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
"Bug is there in recent version, whenever i try to mark incomplete a task a duplicate task comes up with same name again and again. Also we cannot recover our mistakenly deleted task"
Its okay so far but im not sure on how to find the focusing tree part in order for me to stay focused just wondering how you do it other than that not too bad of an app
It is not working
LIKE
"Waiting for the bug to be fixed which causes the tasks to be moved out of order and disappear,otherwise great app."
I want to use this app but i can't do log in. Many times i uninstall and reinstall but prb is still not solved
"Still exploring, sry"
I believe I am rating about getting back on engine browser and phone after batteries or devices cannot interface
Tried it. The app worked well but found something that works better for me personally..🙃
Not so good
This site is most suitable for those who wanted to get a jobs from home Thanks a lot
Great app. But I am not getting notifications even when i set time to remind
Going for free and better Microsoft To-do
So far I'm not impressed and I don't see where it's worth over $40 a year to use... I'm really trying to use it for everything since I did pay for it but to me it's just not worth it.
Not bad
"NEED MORE ×.WITH APP, SO FAR SOGOOD"
"Overall not a bad app. For the first week or so, it gave me notifications when it was supposed to, but after that, it's almost like it forgot sometimes itself, e.g. notification on Saturday when I set it for Friday. Reminders for things I have set daily don't even come up anymore, but it remembers to give me an display-over-app notification to remind me to set a reminder. Also, no push notifications that take you into the app so you'd have to do it yourself. Sub-tasks are my favourite feature!"
Will not let me start the free trial or for that matter purchase an upgrade so for now since it's stuck like me 3. Get it fixed and I'll improve score.
"Hey dev, please bring back old UI in quick add widget... This new update does not have faster and efficient adding task event... Old version was perfect.... Please i have been using anydo since 4 years.... Please don't spoil it.."
"i would honestly give this app a chance if more features were available for free users. a lot of people dont have the money to spend on an app like this, and since there are many other options i will try those instead. premium for this app looks really helpful and the layout of this app is great but im going to have to uninstall since the free version isnt really helpful to me :((("
"I had opted for premium. But even basic things like I wanted to start fresh, so I said delete all tasks, but it added that as a reminder from what's app."
"Nice app, I think, but you need premium to use it. Free version is very ripped off."
Delet
Thank you 😊
Features available in many apps for free are paid here...
I would normally give this 5 stars but the past few days the widget has not allowed me to make tasks on future dates. It just puts the task on todays date. And you cant put tasks on random future days either. Tomorrow yes but i like to plan ahead of tomorrow
Super
don't understand collaborative editing
"Custom sound taken away, now you say they're back, thry aren't showing up. Hit and miss with quick add task doing voice input is annoying too. Make that a setting, but the biggest is the custom sound issue. Now adding a timed reminder is harder, just a tiny little bell icon to try and hit (it's crammed next to other icons, so it's easy to tap the wrong one.) Make better improvements, like a continuous scrolling calendar, instead of it jumping between months for a reminder the next day."
Not very user-friendly. I found it hard to navigate and find what I wanted. It works nicely and I appreciate the simple art style.
"On the widget, Calendar tab not functioning although inside the app already linked my Google calendar."
How do u change it to am or pm because I can't press it and the time is really important
Can't edit the time of a scheduled task and no sound/alarm notifications for the tasks. Edit- sound issue resolved. But still having issues with editing tasks. Not a very user friendly interface.

"It used to be my everyday companion in every organisational way, but after the new update, there was no way to place a new task into the right day. It automatically put the task in the current day, not it's intentional deadline"
Great app and does what I want it to do. (Is my prefered habit tracker ) However I believe the colours should not be a premium feature. Far too expensive as it is the only reason I would get premium! Perhaps make adding wallpapers from gallery a premium feature?
"almost a 5. just integrate google reminders so I can ask google to remind me about things, and keep track of them here. Update: 4/27/20 Google integration is here. It doesn't work. Now you get 3 stars for doing a crappy job 😂"
Reminder sound not sounding
It is better than the normal app in your phone I only wish their was better support for the calendar
Need more user friendly interface. But very useful application my mobile.
"updated review; left review here for wrong app. Not bad so far, migration of data off wunderlist mixed up all the items in the list, sorted by date, not within each list. not necessarily the apps fault. just challenging just to get started. already deleted two other apps that were worse."
Everything is great. But the sort by time isn't working properly.
"I've been using this for a long while now and it remains the penultimate, perfect to-do list app! I recommend it to pretty much EVERYONE I talk to, especially friends, family, and coworkers. -- 4/18/2020: latest update has eliminated the ability to resize widgets as needed. The remaining options are too large or too small."
I asked seven days trial to see whether I like or not and you have already taken the money for the whole entire year that is a rip-off
Tried to share a list with my husband but it won't share between my Office account and his Personal account. It's a show stopper.
"Nice up. The only problem is price. Prices are the same to first world and third world. They don't have option to poor countries only for the rich ones. They don't have even option to students. The product is good, but there's no equality. Sad."
"Don't personally care for the user interface or reminder/plan your day approach. Was looking for something...honestly...simpler. This is over the top for just my husband and I. On the other hand, for a BUSY family or business person, this is exactly what they need."
"So far I am satisfied with this nice app compare to other simlar apps. But one thing I noticed, once I restart my gadget, it automatically clears all the tasks being displayed on my notifications bar. 2020: Notifications bar reminders are not synced with the current date. Why? :("
"When I need it, which is rare z comes in handy .."
"Linked it to my MS exchange, sadly It doesnt show the attachments in my calendar entries...shame as this was looking promising...😒😔"
"Very good app, simple but enough to use, I'm going to get pro. But a question, sync with google calendar, is 1 way sync (only can review), or 2 way sync?"
"The app is great but it would be better if you could increase the payment methods, to upgrade to premium. My debit card isn't supported it says..I live in Pakistan"
"I wish I could pick the day tasks to display on the widget. Since the last update I can only see whole lists, not those I prioritized. Edit: thanks for the response, but this is not true. When I change the layout in the app and delete and reload the widget, it still lists personal first"
All good. Should work on calendar
Love it!! But can't afford premium😞
"Coordinates Humans 🙌🏾 This app was my go-to until covid hit. Keeping my personal, consulting business, and day work calendars in one app was madness. I broke off my day work to microsoft .to do on a separate device. Any.do now coordinates my consulting and my personal and family tasks, lists, and bills. Its refreshing. I do have syncing issues for calendar events as well as a crash everytime I add people to invites when creating an event. Thats why I gave it 4-stars. Love it for tasks."
"Good app. But didnt exceed my expectations to create a google hangouts scheduler. I really want an automatoc hangouts chat scheduled to be sent but when I tried to set it up on zapier, it doesnt work. I had to unsubscribe to yearly premium, Im not sure what gives the premium vs free"
"I have been using this app for years and previous update of ""next 7 days"" update is amazing. I usally plan my day in morning and use widget to view my today's tasks but now app widget shows tasks by category not by next 7 days which has created a serious issue for me. I highly recommend in widget show tasks by day wise list not by category wise otherwise for me and for many this app is useless."
"It's OK but it's not for me. I'm a student and cannot pay for an upgrade in the app. The free options are a bit limited so I, had to delete this app. Hope you enjoy it tho😊 Edit: Thank you for replying. I will make sure to give it another try and re-rate it depending on my second experience :) 2nd edit: it's very helpful. It does what it's created for: planning and keeping your life organized. And with reminders for us forgetful people . Bravo😁 I still feel like its missing something..."
"Great app, but don't want to pay a monthly fee for all the features I don't use. Please offer a one time fee to use a dark theme / mode, so your customers don't have to stare at a glaring white screen. White screens also use more battery power than dark ones, so it also drains your battery quicker. Just about everyone else is offering this option for free, so please offer it to your customers for a reasonable price too. Thank you."
1) It has a calendar feature but you can't customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google (can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry). 2) edit: figured the task sorting part out. Sort by time and collapse upcoming/tomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks. I like that. But it's still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as Google's since that is free.
"Please, if possible, can you make it no limit or larger limit as to how many words you can put in a list? As it runs out rather quickly l. For example if you use it to make a shopping list. Thank you."
"Tried adding some Zapier combinations, but whenever I need to log into something through App's Zapier, it fails. Only works if done outside the app, and outside Any.do. Also it would be a great improvement if the calendar widget would show reminders/tasks as dot too."
Very 👌 nice
Great app. but buggy. Keeps asking me to delete all completed tasks even though it's empty
Good
nice
Initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday. After sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again. Don't know why this happened. If these features go away it will make this app much harder to use. The bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which I have since edited and amended
Best app for ur task management. Edit: for 5 stars u can add more theme options for free version
"Too simplistic, but it's pretty good"
Why notifications are too short? I want to be able custmize my noti sounds!!!
"I've used this app for many years with good experience. Lately the UX and complexity have caused some problems, nonetheless, new features have been very good. However, with the latest update I can no longer see tasks planned for tomorrow, a feature that was the reason for using this app to begin with. It's just gone with no possibility to configure it again. I do understand development of new features, but I do not appreciate removal of features that are being used. Great app, not for me anymore"
還算不錯用！簡單易操作
"It's good app but the calendar view doesn't highlight the day you're on. It's gray like the other days and makes it hard to quicly scroll to today's events. For task view, ,it needs to show the time the task is assigned so you can get it done. However, if you go to calendar view, it will show the task and time."
This is my best to do apps so far and I like it very much. I wish there are some tutorial to give some advice on how to use all the apps potential. And maybe some connection with google assistant and over voice command.
"I love this application so much!!! Good job to the developers. However, I've been having some issues lately with the application. The application refuses to notify me of some tasks I planned to do. When trying to set the time for a reminder, the clock's 5 minutes faster and automatically blocks the other minutes before. As an alternative, I set the date and time using natural language but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Kindly fix this. Once again, it's a wonderful application."
Dark theme should be free 😢
Have the free version and even that is quite useful in terms of ease of use and integration with calendars. Now thinking of upgrading. Could get a 5 then.
Good app
Like this a lot.
"A very good app, easy to write my task and thus no need to remember it, the reminder system is good"
Locking option is not available..All other features are excellent.
"I love Any. but got a few things I don't like. For some reason events cannot be colored when they are written directly to Any.do as it happens on Google Calendar and Zapier doesn't give you that option. I have to write the event in Google Calendar, put the color I want to see it in Any.do. It would be great if you could enable that option. Other idea please put a Report option of things done in the day and task completed. Thanks"
Hh
Good
This rating is for the free version. Most feature rich free version I've tried of other to do list type apps. Interface takes some getting used to but great features and everything seems to be working.
It would be better if there's an icon beside the task so I can easily identify whether a task has some note to it.
"The app keeps getting back to system language even after I selected a different one countless times. I've to select the system language and then select (again) the language I want the app to be with, only for it to go back after a while"
So great. I have suggested this app to many a friend. Suggestion: have the ability to custom the repeat feature in the events. Sometimes things repeat every week but only for 5 weeks.
"Muy buena app, funciona bien y es muy simple e intuitiva. El único pero que le puedo poner es que cuando mando a mis compañeros de trabajo algún quehacer, no siempre llega la notificación"
It's good app for all
I love it so far.
Great
I am using it daily
"Suggestions: - Make the tag colors the background of the task, and not just a small line under the task title. At least have this as an option. - The trees in the Focus mode are all the same no matter how quick or long you do a task. Add variety to this mode: trees/plants to choose from, other decorations, probably even animals or different landscapes. Add more music to choose from, too. I definitely love the look and feel of this app. I enjoy it better with Premium, though."
"Good design, features.."
I really enjoy using the app but I want to suggest a daily summary of tasks to be done (in the morning) and tasks completed and those that were not. Thanks for your hard work.
I dont like that ths deleted or finished every day just let the incomplete ones roll over and the completed ones stay back
"There's a bug where I set a reminder on Saturday weekly then after I saved it, it shows Friday on the screen."
It is very nice app. It would be good if you could add due date option for tasks
A good app to remind me of things I need to do
Gr8
Excited
Very useful
Make dark theme available in the free app
Can I import my task list from Google keep app
Good
It would be better if there was a voice command like Alexa.
Thanks for the support. Battery optimiser on Xiaomi disables the autostart of the app. It works now
Has been super helpful in organising my days. Has made getting my chores sorted so easy
So far so good
Good
Nice App. Able to manage my tasks
I like this app. It helps me to accomplish my tasks very comfortably. A must have apps for productivity. Thank you
Decent app
It helps me to remember what to do as I forget sometimes. It's a nice application but there would be a slight change in it. There must be a ringtone to remember not any message. As people see calls not messages as my opinion.
"This app is brilliantly developed with all necessary features. But few things disappoints us. We cannot set sound notification, it pop-ups only if we are using mobile. Sometimes it doesn't remind us the scheduled activity even in notification. If these bugs are fixed I'll definitely go for paid version with five rating."
Getting better with each up date.
App parfaite si vous voulez vous tenir à jour et savoir où vous en êtes avec vos tâches/missions. versions gratuite avec quelques publicités mais rien de vraiment méchant. A tester absolument !
Love it
Super
Any.Do moment new colored style isn't good.
This app was great a year or two ago. They spam you now with premium service purchase requests (which are costly) and have restricted all the good options to their premium service.
Help you alot to plan your day
Great app. I really like the integration with other apps like Gmail and Trello etc. My only problem is it sometimes doesn't show notifications.
Good app
It's great
TonyR.Suarez penaurree
Good
Amazing app pretty good to remember you what you should do :3
Nice
Interesting but personally not needed.
Good app but eventually stopped using it as it didn't fit my needs exactly.
Ol
"I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself."
"If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :)"
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks
"I love the app, 8have been usinfg it for quit a while now, the only thing I font like is that it only has a list option, though I wish to make a morning routine on it, please see this and fix it, thank you!"
It has been very useful for me.
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.
Adding Habit Tracker would be useful.
"Love the app, but frequent changes to the UX are frustrating. I manage to get used to changes, develop some muscle memory, and more changes come. The new snoozing experience is very slow! It may be flashy, but it's just painfully slow, it's an added inconvenience. Please at least make it an opt-in feature."
"This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore."
Easy to use interface... Premium account links into other APPS
"Relocate the *Delete Task* & *Mark as Done* tabs. I have a Galaxy Note 10+, and, quite likely w/ other phones, when i motion to press my *navigation button* on the bottom right or the *open application button*, on the bottom left, i am frequently accidentally tapping the *mark as done* or *delete task* tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that I was already working with. Aside from being increasingly frustrating, aggravating, and annoying, this becomes a time waster."
"Honestly, needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for (I tried out the free trial). The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)? Then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching. Other than that, it's a nice productivity app. Love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar"
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?
"Clean, simple interface. Generally fast and easy to add things as I think of them. However.....I wish the app didn't think it was so smart. I find the auto-spelling annoying. Putting in 8-10 ft. electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as August 10th. And the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying. 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories. Changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage (and why do they show up under Tasks at all?)"
"A perfect app to prioritize daily tasks, yet the U.I is still not up to mark."
99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.
"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues"
Nice app foe reminder
"Great app, very usable, lots of features...but 36$ a year for premium? That's almost as much as I pay for my premium password manager, and that's much more complicated and costly to develop and maintain. This is a GREAT app, but there's no way I'm going to pay that much."
Nice app very useful
Nice
"Easy to use and very straightforward, no fuss just works perfectly with timely reminders."
Helpful app. Thanks for the good work.
"Any.do is gradually becoming my daily tool for managing my schedule, tracking customer debt position. It is a rewarding experience for d money."
"I reinstalled 5 times but is'nt working basically It is'nt singing with any of 3 methods. Plese fix It, I am unable to use such a good application."
The app lacks tools to view how good I am keeping up with my daily habit/recurring tasks.
"Very good planning organizer, but there's still few bugs here and there. In the grocery list, why i can't open the completed lists? It's always close again after 1 second. Please fix."
Very nice
Great app but needs work.
"Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice."
"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users."
Goood
Good
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version
So far so good. I just dont like the fact that it has payment to get full features and it's quite expensive.
Great
Great app for tracking tasks. Could use some work on gesture/finger detection. For example I will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save. Pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits.
Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings. Thanks
Good note
"It is great, but it would be better if the sort by Time feature is really sort it by Time. Not only today, tomorrow, and upcoming. It is really inconvenient if in the Upcoming tasks, it is not sort by time."
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.
"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult."
This app really help me.😊
How to disable the everyday 9am reminder to keep a reminder? Honestly don't need it. That's just a noise!
No pop-up reminders because we use planner as we forget.
"The grocery lists don't work on Huawei P30 Pro after your last update. The different list sections fold and unfold by themselves. It became impossible to use them. Fix it and I'll give you 5 stars again. Thanks for the follow up, I edit the review to 4 stars by now for the good customer service. Waiting for the big to be fixed!"
"Increase my productivity, helps me to remind, and also the price for premium version is also very less."
It helped me
"I LOVE this app. It was the one I narrowed down to after having downloaded several to-do apps. HOWEVER, I wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember, without it being attached to a to-do item. I also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage, there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user. (An easier way to undo checking off a list item, being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks)"
Love this app.. But I wish i can add due date for my task.
Très pratique !
"Are the tasks created in this apo visible in Google calendar? If yes, how to set that up?"
Very good app for manage the things. Easy to use.
I can hardly give up on this app. It is so intuitive even though there are still things to improve. 1-Shortcut to grocery list 2-Displaying time of the task in the widget
Its good and does the job
I started with the subscription primarily because of the NLP. Does it support recurring tasks with NLP ? The integrations are awsome!
"Great app for goal makers, but there are some premium features . Please make them free to use. It's a humble request."
Subscribe by hi iam vimal
Good
Had an issue but it was handled right away.
Great
Great App for planning my day
It's simply the best 😁 ❤️
"Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added."
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget
Do i need to pay?
Great app! It makes my family and me do specific tasks. I would give it a 5 star review but sometimes the notification doesn't pop up at all.
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
I m new to used
I think that a bug when I set tag for the goal they sometimes disappear
Nice
Timely
"Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U"
Simple and useful. Liked the widget too.
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium."
Good
"The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star. Edit: issue was solved and I got a refund for the extra money that was charged, all's well that ends well."
"Would love to have been able to plan out a week and see it rather than having today, tomorrow, and upcoming. I use the calendar feature a lot, though and it is super useful"
"This app is good. I use it daily and it runs my life. I have too many tasks though, and anydo's plan my day feature is good at forcing me to postpone stuff to next week, repeatedly. Pls add a built in optional Eisenhower matrix tagging system - tag each item with a quadrant label. Add a matrix view option to view all today's tasks in quadrant view, with filters for specific list only or all items. It's hard work retyping any do items into other apps to view like this"
Very practical and usefull application
Nice app which reminds us our tasks and events
I like thid
Super
Good
Useful
Boo.
"This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher"
Helpful 😁
"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off."
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??
UPDATE: Tags have started syncing back again. Tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app. I am a premium user and I put in a ticket about the issue. After frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I will update my rating after the issue has been fixed.
"Integrates well with my work flow. I had difficulty in understanding the 'My Lists' so instead I ""listed"" My projects instead...works, now integrates well with what I do and the tags differentiates similar project ""lists"". I accidentally deleted my shopping list when I really wanted to remove some items...but its growing on me."
Is this a free app or have to subscribe (& pay) to use beyond 7 days?
Only one suggestion: an option for big tasks. Sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time.
this is a good app
Great.. and i liked it more than todoist..
Best to do list apk I have ever used.
Alot of great features and cry informative and reminds you as well . Great for me thumbs 👍
"Another app that what's my info by having me sign in. EDIT: I rethought my 1 🌟 as I don't want to sync just use, doesn't mean the app isn't good."
Not always where it should be. does not always popup when set on samsung galaxy 9. very few aps rate 5 stars as very few have no problems at all. 5 stars woould say it works perfectly from my perspective.
It was perfect until the new update on Huawei P20 Lite. More precisely with the short cut (widget) on a main screen. Please sort this out. Thanks
I love this app Previous issue of being randomly logged out was resolved
Great app for managing your activities. Been using this for 3 years and it still meets my requirement in managing my to-do's
Great app. Love using daily
Feel good help me for rewind my task
A very good reminder app.
I love this app
"Please add option of grouping lists or creating sections into lists, so that we can have sub-lists. Rest it's good. Please make a note taking app also. You make amazing apps."
Good
I have never see such wonderful application before
"Good integration with Google home, but needs widget to be able to access the shopping list"
"simplistic, easy and very useful Edit: Google voice demand beep cannot be muted?"
good one..nit n clean ..liked it.
Plan my day should be free...
Sounds alittle hard and complicated to me Good app btw...
I was finally able to get this installed- yay! My husband also put it on his phone so we can share the grocery list and others. I've updated to 4 stars as it seems to be working now. Thanks! Can't get it to finish installing and I have plenty if room. Gets to 97% and then stops. I will revise my review if I ever get to try it!
This app is awesome. I am currently using the free version and it had everything I need. It truly makes it easy for you to stai organized and not lose tracks of priorities.
Great product
"Great app, helps me to plan my day ahead"
"This app is amazing, changed my life. I'm doing 3x tasks daily since I installed the app, I can't be lazy. The pro version is expesive for a student in my country."
Good app 🙂👍
I like this app. It is the most simple and straight forward of its type that I've found.
Very good

"I started using this a week ago, it has already became a useful tool for being productive. Really recommend downloading"
Good experiment.
Amazing and fantastic app❤️
Interesting
i like that app
Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!

Best reminder ever

I loved it.
Likes it very much
I began using this app 18months ago after having a baby and feeling that i was never feeling organised. It has been a game changer in helping me schedual all of the little things and keeping me on track
"What i love a most is integration with whatsapp, feels like have a private secretary."
Spr remainder
Very useful aap. I am satisfied
Thanks a lot for the reply! It's working great again like before!! 😄😄 (Small suggestion: maybe make this fact more obvious from the app UI or provide sort order as an option for the widget 😀) Thanks again!
It's awesome. I've tried some other apps but didn't find as much productive as it.
ok
"Truly amazing. One of the apps that I kept installing even after switching phones. Really helps me to organise my day better. LOVED the interface too, smooth and professional"
Very useful app. Thanks to the developers!
Great To do App
Encourages me to do more!
Love this app. Used it for years!
Amazing app! Just one suggestion please please add feature of setting time in subtasks as well. It would be a really great feature making the app more wholesale!!
"Been using it for years and planning everything in this app - from work to home payments. As a premium user I really enjoy the lightning fast support, which solves the rare issue that might occur. Five stars!"
This app is great! I'm able to use an online scheduling tool without having to pay for a subscription. Helps me stay on task at work.
This app gets better all the time. I'd be lost without it... And so easy to use!!
Awesome app the best
My personal secretary

Very very helpful and easy to use as well. 'Must Have' app.👍👍
Write down something on your mind and come back to it later - life saver - store all my thoughts and important revelations in the app to be worked on later
New to it but I think it's going to make my life easier

Superb 😍
"Use this app every day. The only problem is that when you place an item to do in a specific place on a specific day, the item jumps to the top of the day or to the bottom of the list by itself and you have to re-place it."
Nice app
"IT'S AMAZING,IT HELPS ME BE MORE ORGANISED"
This is awesome
Helps very well with work.
Best app keep it up
I loving this app. It's make me a better people

My experience is good so far.

I live it

Forget everything and enjoy the life. Any.do will ensure you don't forget anything. It's really an excellent app to manage your everyday task so that you should not miss anything from your 'To Do' list. It's quite helpful in every day life. Thanks a lot.
Great to keep important things in front of me for a busy schedule. Love the option for when you can set each reminder for.
Cheap paid version... covers all u need to maintain a todo list
Good remind me to check

"Excellent customer service and very reasonable staff. They tried to reach me within a week, their responses were very clear and not once did they blame me for any issues I had run into. Overall, a great experience. The app itself is nice as a To-Do list or to organize your numerous tasks by due date, categories as well as location."
The 1st October update has an issue in widget. The repeated tasks remain on top despite you mark then done for today.
"I love this app, and I can't start my day without it, but lately with the new updates I got lost with my tasks list the feature of having today tomorrow and upcoming tasks had been gone which is not good at all. I stopped using the app actually I hope the management of this app will look into this issue and fix it otherwise I will need to look for another app"
👍
Intuitive and motivating way of zooming through your task lists!
The best.Pop up reminder is useful as it constantly pops up at the specified time and you can't avoid it until you reset the time and date.This is useful.
Class
Best app I have found
"Good, and the most important thing: it's free to use and the basic feature is more than enough for me Been using this for 3 years+, keep it up!"
"I love this app, it really helps me manage everything in my life."
Good app
Nice
Nice easy way to track tasks in different parts of your life.
It is absolutely the best tool
Excellent
"Only thing that could make this better and maybe I'm just too dumb to figure out, lol, how to make it work.is if as long as the apps open you could just talk into your phone and say like task/ event instead of having to stop and type it you know but that's my two cents I still love it thank you"
Good
So far so good I just download this to help my husband be more organized.
"I like this app for the most part. Loads of different plugins however if you want to change the date for your reminder from the default date, it takes 7 taps! SEVEN! That is not great UX and needs to improve. I miss the Wunderlist style smart date adding. Update: The new smart date feature makes this a 5 star app for me!"
"New navigation is far less convenient than the pre update there should be an option to revert it. Update: Thanks for listening, updated to 5 star for the reply"
Good
Just do it
Great app
The best app ever...worth my money for subscribing.. Cause I'm a student and it's really help me to manage my day
"I adore this app. For an absent-minded-professor type like myself, having everything I need to stay on track and show up all together in one place that can be accessed across platforms is an absolute lifesaver. The UI is really well designed as well. Highly recommend."
Excellent App! Especially for focused practise!
Awesome app
Great update...
2012 REVIEW: Been looking for a simple to do app with drag and drop and this is the best.
Very good! Superb app
Thanks for your help! 😊 If I may I would suggest that you work on newly added tasks - it would be much more convenient if they didn't end at the bottom of the list. Thank you in advance.

Amazing

Wonderful application
Love it! Gives me everything i need and let me do a monthly subscription so that I can have the few extras that you get with the paid version. Free or paid are worth it
Very nice app👍

super task app
Possibly the best reminder app on the play store
You wont steal my information right?
Just what I needed! It's a big help for organising tasks and setting reminders when I'm at work.
Great app to record and follow up for your daily activities
I really love it
I love this app
Wonderful experience in the free version itself . let's you organize your day and make it optimally productive

Perfect so far 👍

I've used a lot of task lists and this one is my favorite. It is so flexible and I can use it for all areas in my life.
Awesome
Reminder isnt part of standard app. Needs upgrade
Reminders are a premium feature you have to pay for. This should be basic.
"Using this app for atleast 5+ yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature !! I mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that's unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start. Goodbye Todoist Edit (after reply): So you mean, me & every other person who is complaining are all wrong. Reminders were never premium until some time ago. I was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan. Have courtesy to not lie atleast :("
"I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this. Come on Todoist! Reminders should never be a ""Premium Feature"" in a task management app!!!"
I was super happy to download this app but that I soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your to-do list
"I would give todoist more than five stars; However, you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible, please add an option to always show completed tasks!"
Not good
"Horrible, most of it you have to pay. Even to put a simple reminder."
Why do I have to create an account and sign in for a simple to do app? Hella sus
No reminder options for free version of this app. How can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for. My alarm clock would be better than this app. Sorry I don't recommend.
Lack of reminder in free version
I don't liked becous it is not have the time in my tasks day 😭😧😩😢☹️🙄
I will increase one star each day it will help me achieve my goals.
"Developer holds notifications as ransom for a monthly payment. Would be acceptable for a small membership fee, but I have to pay for all of premium just to get notifications, the whole point of a to-do app? No thanks."
"Constantly buggy. I've used this app for five years, and they are always pushing bad releases. Right now there is a crash expanding lists, which would have been found with some quick testing. Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months. They must do zero quality control."
Why is alarm feature premium? It's the most basic utility someone expects from a to-do app.
"PROBLEM WITH NEW UPDATE. Since the latest update, the app keeps crashing everytime I try to expand a task's subtasks using the built in ""down arrow"" button on the right side of the screen. PLEASE FIX."
"12 hours, just 12 hours I had this app. Received 6 emails for todoist. Why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email? On top of the email issue, to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service. Wont be coming back. Uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list. Pathetic!"
Doesnt Nofication me
"Cant use it if notifications dont work. Wont pay if I cant full feature test.....lets take this Corolla for a test drive, we can pretend its the Supra you imagine it might be... but first pay us to find out where you were just imagining vs how it really works....lol. Too bad, genuinely need a good working product.No thanks, it always requires mindless divulging of my banking info, you cant have that, if you have a product you trust let me see it,if I like it,you can have my banking info. Lol"
"For getting something basic of having reminder is a premium feature in this app, which does not make any sense to a reminder app"
"Very simple check list application, if you don't pay no teminders, no comments, nothing. Also there's no even taking simple notes stuffs. Just checklist and and sub task. If you want very basic, use it but tick tick ist best one. Sorry guys. It's reality"
"I like the concept but it is very complicated, specially entering recurring tasks or editing."
"Really ,push notifications and notifications in general as a premium feature in a to do app....i know you need to make some buck out of this masterpiece, but did you really had to restrict the feature people use to do list apps for."
"cant use for reminders so what, good is this app for?"
Requires sign in. Lol no.
"On free version can't even set a specify time for a task (can only set a date), nor set a reminder. What's the point of a to do list app without these functions? Uninstalled."
"Need to pay $36 for gerring reminders, the most basic feature of a to-do app. It's like ordering the most expensive gourmet dish at a 5 star hotel and then the hotelier asking for additional money to add salt to the food. LOL. Better to use Microsoft to do and lot of others!"
This app is a joke They want you to pay for simple feature like reminder whats the purpose of free app then make it all paid
No reminder alert for free version.
Why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app.. what dev.. you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that. Ridiculous.. uninstalled.. just needed a to do list app as simple as that.
👎 notifications $
"Not intuitive. I swear items have disappeared. If you want to see what you have already done, you have to pay for premium. No thanks. Back to using Keep."
Not so great app apart from its natural language input. Only recently added kanban view but lacks any basic requirements like reminders in the free version. Also the android widget hangs almost always. Never gets updated.
Very bad app does not work
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes."
"I didn't get even the access to add lables and reminder which done for free by many others. I look forward for doist to include at least lables and reminders with the free plan. I really loved but without the mentioned features in the free plan, I don't want to make it my to do list app."
All functionality comes with premium account only... Shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version
"Good design but when you uncheck items on a list it doesn't put them back into their original order, making it pretty much useless."
"Reminders are a PREMIUM feature for some ungodly reason. They are a must for a todo app, what's point of writing it down if you keep FORGETTING it?!"
Data-mining rubbish
"It is reliable. The app itself is great. I give one star for the price only. Condering my phone have ""reminder"" app that is free and built in. This app is really just ""burning"" my money. Thanks but no thanks."
Downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories. Opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone.
ridiculously complicated
Spam
"For sure, this app is good enough, but! After a year of usage they added reminder feature to a premium access. Without reminders your app is useless. Thanks a lot. Even comments went to premium. Completely useless app."
This app does not work on my smartwatch. I am not able to log in.
"Starting out this app was ok, but then I started noticing how limited this is for the free version. Only 10 projects, and where did my completed tasks go? Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily. I don't know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for ""daily"", but it's lame!"
"Extremely complicated to use. can't understand a thing. good app, but it needs a whole tutorial because it does so much"
"Keeps spamming your email (even after you uninstall the app) with marketing emails. No, I don't want your app, I did not like it, I did not subscribe to you email subscriptions, get lost"
doesn't actually store any notes
"used to be my favorite apps, but sync bugs drove me crazy too many times, auto replace link with title made me mad, cancelled subscription & uninstalled"
"I am colour blind and dyslexic. Not able to read anything. I can't zoom in and I need to pay in order to see the colours better. [update] As I said, I would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so I can actually read and make use with it. I've tried WeNote, and it's the app I need, without having to pay premium."
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease."
Worst most useless app I've had the misfortune to try. Literally zero point in having this over Google calendar. Don't waste your space. It's useless. You can't have recurring tasks& everything is behind a pay wall. Avoid.
"I can't do the things I want , like setting alarm"
NOBODY IS RESPONDING TO MY SUPPORT EMAIL IT HAS BEEN DAYS WHAT IS THIS? I NEED HELP ALL MY INFO IS GONE AND NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING FOR DAAAAYYSSSSSS
Everything was a purchase immediately after downloading. Bummer
"Please allow more complexity in setting recurring tasks for example daily routine go to bed at 10pm ev weekday and go to bed at 12am ev fri, sun. It's frustrating having to create multiple tasks for the same recurring task just because I want it set to a different time. Will leave my review at 1 star and upgrade to 5 once fixed. Look forward to any updates from Devs on this one."
"LOL greedy app devs. They charge $36 annually or $48 if you select the monthly option. If you get the premium version, it'll allow you to receive push-notifications for a scheduled task. Like, to set a timer / alert for something on your list. Uninstalled. For $40, the app better be making you breakfast in the morning."
"WARNING RE THIS APP. Got Premium, followed instructions to Integrate w/calendar w/vpn active, got security alert minutes later that an attempt was made to login to my email account w/my password. Had to hustle to protect my account. Thank you Google for superb alerts, shame on you Todoist for open back doors."
"This is the to do app with the best features (or just the features I personally need). However, my recurring tasks keep disappearing, which is simply unacceptable behaviour for a to do app."
"You will be asked to upgrade to a premium just for the sake of adding reminders. Well that is not satisfying, reminders should be available just in the beginning."
"Fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done. ""Natural language"" will no way allow me to set a task called ""Register for 3 Oct SAT test"" for this Friday. Something simple as adding a note requires Premium. I'm going back to ToDo"
Too expensive. Ticktick is better
Too complicated and not well organized
It started to send emails asking me to add go running or make coffee..I wanted a todo list that I could share with my wife..not another wife telling what I should be doing
"What good is a todo list app without a reminder, why would you make the most important thing a premium feature. Don't download this app it's USELESS!!"
App is not starting.. just showing blank black screen
Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.
"Minimal features to force premium purchase. This app advertises itself as a an alternative to Microsoft for people forced to migrate from Wunderlists. Wunderlists was an excellent, fully featured list app with reminders, repeatable tasks, folders to group similar lists, and the ability to share any list with anyone via email or the Wunderlist app. Todoist allowed import from Wunderlist and mostly supported these features until summer 2020 update made every useful feature ONLY be in premium."
This app let's you create 1 list then when you go to create the next one you can't without paying.
Cannot delete account. Tired of getting email notification everyday. Worst app ever
It is the worst app in my life .!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!
Charges for service not received. Can not contact
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does."
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list
Worst only useful when you are using premium
Too complicated so uninstalled but still getting unasked for and annoying emails every day.
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib .
"In daily tasks, if i tap once on yesterday, it becomes tomorrow. Where is today?"
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it"
"Daily emails, can't even see my important emails because of spammers like you"
Not really usefull too difficult to use
Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.
What good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders
Without paid membership there was no use of this app.. so guys don't download it.
"You want me to pay you monthly so I can have a reminder?! Ahahaha, you must be out of your mind!"
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634
"Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally"
"glad i only selected 1 month. they try too much to make a sleek design, that its counter intuitive, especially for repeating tasks."
"This app will send spam everyday, even when you block them."
👎
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated"
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway
REMINDERS are a PREMIUM FEATURE in a TO-DO APP? Really????
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap."
"Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get."
Every thing is for premium users!
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing"
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete"
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money
"Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app."
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day."

"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools."
"bug bug bug bug bug, please don't tell me these bugs are features because i am a android programmer too."
Log in required
"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task."
"No free trial, cant even try it, JUNK. then they spam you forever"
I need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry.
"Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY."
No options to repeat a task. Why else would i want a to do list? Might as well use a pen and paper.
No Reminder option. Why u showcase it in ad when it's a paid service?
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!"
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!
Can't work effectively on the free version
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!"
You create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really....
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄"
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled."
"The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps."
"I've used the new major redesign for a month or two now, and it's definitely a step back. Especially on desktop web. Editing is such a chore now, I hate the pop-up!"
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!"
I dont need my card to set the reminder
"2 out of 3 features require premium. No, I am not going to do that."
it is impossible uninstall this one
Reminders is a paid feature. What a joke.
", every time I put a task in it removed the number in the name and put it in my inbox.... Why???"
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it."
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders
Subscription for reminders $5. Well it's fine I will move to Google Tasks.
"The smart schedule feature was removed without notice. Until that's fixed to me, the app is like any other to-do app, I've started to look elsewhere"
Worst
"Will never touch this app again! Tried twice - on both occasions I've regretted it. Considering alternatives like TickTick or even Microsoft Todo, I don't know why you would actually pay for this. Not worth the money. Support is also condescending and incompetent. It's all good though - you got my money. 🤬"
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks."
Baad
Many features are available just for premium
Garbage
Time reminder available to to premium only ..??? Really !!! 🤬🤬🤬 pretty desperate to earn some bucks .
"Looks like it would be a nice app, but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an in-app purchase"
Reminders are behind a paywall
Used to be affordable. Now more expensive than US pricing!
"One of the key premium features of this app is labeling, which unfortunately doesn't work properly. When I try to move a label to a shared section, the app crashes. Additionally there is an inconsistency between Android and iOS in how the labels work. In Android I can see the whole list of labels even without tasks, on iOS a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label. This together makes sharing labeled tasks with my wife really annoying"
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality."
Boring
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.
Everything included in premium feature . Only frame work is there.
Widget not loading?!?
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know."
No notification on free version ☹️
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads"
It disturbs when they send unnecessary e-mails
"The natural language thing is a gimmick and a nightmare to use. Simple tools would be so much easier. Despite paying for Premium, just to get reminders, it took me almost 10 minutes to set a recurring task and it still didn't automatically set a reminder. I've been patient, I've tried, I've read and re-read all the rules (spent hours trying to learn everything) but it still doesn't work. It obviously works for most people but I found it to be an over-complicated and frustrating waste of time."
"I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend."
I dont like this
Basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.
"Guys, what is a task limit? Why? It's not the way it should be."
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!
Everything behind a pay wall...
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme."
"Reminders, the most basic of features, is ""premium"" in this app."
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP."
There are no recurrent feature. Reminders feature is premium.
"Please revert to your old version & interface! The new widget has made the app completely unusable. It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date."
After the latest update I cannot find a way to sort my All list by due date any more. Thus the app is now useless to me.
everything is premium 🐸
Requires account. It's free because they make money harvesting your data.
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore
"I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch."
"Subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous. I was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app, but having to pay nearly $5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd. Once I saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall, I had to stop using it"
"""Reminders are a premium feature"""
"Two word - Paid mess. Please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice , just go for a better app."
"Don't lock reminders behind a pay wall, or if you do, make it a 1 time purchase."
"Update 04.2020 - this is getting worse and worse still, with every update. Now they made it harder to edit your task - they moved it behind two clicks. Why?? Seems like this app is moving away from the todo-app for power users to just another todo app, same as any other. This is the last time I paid for the premium subscription. Time to move. ----- It used to be the best for power users, but after the latest ""updates"", the app keeps getting worse and worse. I am not really sure who this updates are for, definitely doesn't seem like it's for its core user group."
"Rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working. Rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear, earlier I have experienced that it duplicated tasks. This way a basic functionality is broken and I just lost what should I follow-up today... No activity log available, as that is a paid feature. I guess I will never try that now."
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.
I want to schedule a task daily ! Should I add it every day ?! What's the way ??
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling."
Good
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app
I will use other app. I will not pay
Not easy to use. Horrible design.
Needs registration. Can't use existing caldav task accounts
In basic app why can't even add comment its not even basic when it comes to free.
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.
Requires my email? No thanks.
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app."
The Google Calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months. They don't fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication. TickTick is becoming very tempting.
Pay to remind??? Really???
Total waste of money.
"I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me"
"This app is ok, but it really needs start date functionality. Their reasoning behind not adding it is terrible."
"Team , I took subscribtion but app is not working. I try to add task but I can't see the text etc. Something is wrong."
not convenient for users
Reminder is under premium! Seriously! Must need unstall
"Love the idea and functionality of the app but it consistently crashes for me. Luckily it saves the last edits made, however, it is still hard to use when it crashes so often"
"Everything great. But you guys have made basic reminder a premium feature, very disappointed 😞"
"Just needed somthing to record things I have to do and to remind when I should do them, then got hit instantly with a paywall, not a cool start tho."
"App is not for me. I paid $4.00 for 1 month of Premium service and is still shows I am using the free app. I immediately contacted customer service (twice), and it's been more than 2 weeks into the 1 month I paid for and I still have not received a response from anyone at Todoist. I'm still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs, but since I don't have the Premium app in order to do that, I will be uninstalling this app."
Not helpful
"Overrides set task order if priority is not at the same level - your selected chronological order will be ignored without any option to disable this. If tasks are completed and restored they go to the end of the list, not the position you chose making this inappropriate for projects that are recurrent like mapping out activities of daily living. 1 star from me + an extra since order may not be important to others (eg. for shopping lists)."
If paid account bit costly
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.
No reminders in free version. And pro version is very costly. They should lower their prices according to PPP. Todo list without reminders is useless. I can use any notepad app instead of free version of todoist.
Everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it. A simple push notification and you want me to pay for it.
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?"
"When i type some words in the task they just disappear (eg sun) Doesnt allow me to rearrange the tasks under the project, this is a basic feature."
Reminder is chargeable service . No point
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick."
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...
"Earlier it was an excellent app without premiums on reminders and many-many other stuff, literally everything was available. But with time it got only worse, these complicated swipes, circles instead of checklists, and ""modern"" trendy design while neglecting intuituve and easy style. And now what I see, after a year? Everything got even worse. What happened with you?"
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit."
Most of it's premium.
"App is good enough but drains your battery, for that reason I'm uninstalling it."
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.
Too complex
A lot of functionality but not so simple to use
That app is good but I could not benifit
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!"
"Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks"
"I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this."
Almost no productivity without premium version.
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.
Everything is premium
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes todoist and chome :( :( :("
Sort by priority is missing
"The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated."
"every now and then, out of blue, it stops syncing across platforms I use. last time it was buggy update, this time is sfsin no idea why."
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list...."
Paywall heavy
I realy didn't like titack is better to me.
Disappointing...
"Normal app the most features on premium account like backup cloud, comment, labels and reminders too."
"Not for me, im trying to setup notif: take medicine at 4 am. Need to pay. Sorry, no."
"After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either."
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further."
"After getting the premium subscription I found that, Windows 10 app doesn't have any app lock mechanism. So anyone using the machine has access to Todoist! I'd request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features."
"Reminders are a 'premium' feature. No thanks, uninstalling."
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!"
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this."
Cost$$$$$$
"Can't really do anything on the free version. No reminder, no scheduling"
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature
Did I read that right? To add reminders to my tasks will cost me £36 per year? Are you crazy?
Simple function like sort by name isn't working. Shame.
"Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users."
"I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane."
"The new widget is terrible. Even in non-compact view, the elements are too small. And I can no longer access the main app window from the widget. This was possible earlier."
"I'm changing my review from 5 to 2. I'm a pro subscriber and love this app, but latest widget changes for Android are truly terrible. I can't click the todoist icon to get the app open anymore because that's gone, I can't click the reschedule shortcut button anymore because that's also gone, and I can't select multiple tasks to mark done at once via the widget anymore. But hey it's transparent now! Horrible update and I hope the team behind this update sees this review."
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.
Only for singlr use.. cant assign task and sub task to others
Y.
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue."
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist."
Not flexible enough for my needs
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement."
"New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise."
So you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium? NO still doing normal in everything else
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon."
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article 😡😡😡? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.
The new update destroyed the widget. Terrible.
"--- EDIT: there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date: ""tomorrow"" is sometimes sent to next week and ""next week"" the week after. I double checked my datetime settings. --- Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage."
"New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now."
"They fixed the crashing issue. Awesome. My impression of the app was 5 stars after that. What brings me back though is the latest GUI change to the widget. 2 stars now. They took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks. I am considering switching task managers now. I do not see a way to restore the old functionality. Also I used to be able to launch ToDoist from the widget. That button is gone now too. I am a long time user. I've reached the """"enlightened"""" rating on the app. Boo..."
"The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great."
Too complex
Why would I pay for this app for reminders? It's just a goddamn simple feature!
Subscription required just to set a reminder.
"While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy."
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work."
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially."
"Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time). In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service? How is your data management & security? Does your company view people's data? How do you keep others from being to steal others data, because username & passcodes..."
Why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point.. You guys are just a company trying to get rich.
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved."
"Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders."
There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.
Reminder requires payment
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions."
expensive
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.
The main feature does not work - it doesn't remind me about todo with system notification
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.
"New update is incredibly finicky and makes it difficult to add existing items to projects, change dates, etc. Appending a task with #project_name no longer adds it to the project, it just takes it as a string literal."
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time."
Not very user friendly.
"Looks great, but not useful in free plan. And it's very expensive."
Yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker."
"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again."
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.
گزینه آندو ش میپره
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time)."
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you."
"Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :("
(Sep 2013) took almost 1 year for decent reminders. Is still annoying to click twice to view the notes. Not very productive! (Oct 2019) with new interface the notes disappeared. The interface is just a copy of Wunderlist or TickTick. What is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality (reminders and notes) for nothing?
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.
To many features locked behind premium
New layout and functionality is no bueno. Don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks. Please fix!!!
Gud
Would even pay & advertise but I am not able to see in one view WHEN future stuff is taking place...
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???
Versão Free não faz quase nada. Quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead."
You can't have your to do list as notifications
"I hate when the things are no clear, basic features as reminders are in the premium membership"
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks."
It just feel old...
"Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy."
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
You have to upgrade to get notifications...
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope."
"Its good for making lists, but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium, its just not for me"
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive."
"I tried the free version. I liked the way, that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself, but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus. I prefer to use Google task app, that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task."
Tedious and annoying to use. Went back to using Google Keep.
cant make into my calendar
No longer able to add note to Todoist quickly using Google and Note-to-self. Yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds. Not sure if this is a Google change or a Todoist change but it removes one of the most useful parts on Todoist. I am a LONG TIME premium user looking for another tool.
"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required."
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part ."
why does my theme switch from dark to light every time i open the app?
use Google tasks instead
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling."
"I am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks/projects I have scheduled, so I end up missing out on things I want to take care of. I have it turned on in Settings. Why is that?... I utilize the Smart Schedule tool, but still no notification. Pls help or fix."
"Awful UX/UI - I don't like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks. I like old fashioned controls, but Todoist is just trying to be different for no reason. Was on Premium for several months and gave it a fair shot - needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and switched to TickTick instead. I don't normally downvote apps, but this just didn't do it for me, and I spent money on it. I should have ignored the hype, so the fault is mine."
"Mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly, why can you do it from only projects? Why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right (to much marks is completed) allow a simple option on the menu. Deleting tasks is several options in etc. Doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating. Needs some real UX love."
"technically a paid app(pay for reminders), UI not as attractive as related apps."
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker."
Too many premium features
Notifications don't sync without opening the app.
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick."
should tell the cost first
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.
"The update got rid of a major tool for me. You can no longer press and hold the task to bring up the option to delete it. Not even sure how you delete on mobile now, which is very inconvenient!"
Doesn't even come close to Wunderlist or Any.do unless you pay.
need to learn more
"I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?"
"I have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating. Before applying the update, I had hoped to find documentation about changes. Found nothing on the todoist website, no comments in reviews. Update is attempting to be pushed, where's the documentation????"
"Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix. For everyone else,my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until I can remove the complete buttons, shrink text, have fully customizable widgets, or settle on another app. but really, focus on the root problem."
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!"
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea"
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free."
"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden. Siehe Oben."
"It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update. The checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete. This is a bad, bad deal. I use Todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses. If I errantly check off a task, it could cost me a lot of money, and possibly lose me a client. Hopefully you'll fix this right away."
Have to pay for labels. there's no separate sections for different categories on widget
very simple design that makes adding a task complex! also most useful features are premium.
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one."
"Has become much worse when the sub tasks were removed, I liked having categories of my tasks sorted out into the categories. Please add back in the option to have subtasks show."
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such luck😢"
Wunderlist is much better
"cannot enter how long a task will take, which severely limits its use for scheduling"
i never understand why they never update or upgrade thier bad subtask? working under 2 years (I am using premium account) and managed hundred projects which I seen this app to weak too continue. I cannot handle subtask and moving them together that is really problems but they never fixed. i think i will change another for next project. this is enough. thank you
it works. but WAY TOO EXPENSE and compkicated than most user will need. this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating.
"Removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version, and the price is way to high. looking elsewhere :-("
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me."
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.
Mahal. Harus bayar mahal untuk bisa mendapatkan fitur2 penting
Really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basis...would have been happy with one time charge but not worth $36 a year when there is better for less...
The free version is very limited
"Difficult onboarding, no integration with google calendars, documentation is not very clear."
reminder is a premium feature. really? the app isn't user friendly.
its an average app to waste time on and increasing your work
Looks good until you have to pay 3£/month to add labels
Free features are MUCH better in Wunderlist app and second best would be Any.do.
The free version has a minimal functionality. There more advanced free apps on the PlayStore.
The chrome extension is awesome but not the mobile app.
"As someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing, I find it insulting Todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one-time unlock. That's just greedy."
"... hampered by the fact that too much of the functional tweaks are paid ones, COMPARED to dozens other to-do app I've tried and used. =( Seriously, the UI/UX is informative, the paid one is very multifunctional yet still as simple as possible, and the categorization/tagging feature is a hoot. I WOULD SOOO USE IT if not for that fact."
Limited features with the trail/free version !!
it's good to do stuff but it won't let me see the tasks I've completed
items/tasks disappear; Search is hard to use; Annoying user interface to enter due dates that require you to remember esoteric lexicon to do things like reoccurring dates.
Premium or nothing.
"Hi,  I am using Vivo V5 Plus handset. I had downloaded ""Todoist"" for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work, if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen.  Kindly help me in this regard."
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly.
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.
"Worthless. Contacted ""support"" through the app over a week ago, and still no reply. I paid for the year, but I will be cancelling it, as paying to have basic features on this app is a ripoff for the customer. Crazy to think I paid and still get no support. Go with another app and save yourself the money an the hassle of Todoist. THANKS. UPDATE: THEY HAVE FINALLY REPLIED, SO UP TO 4 STARS, AS AT LEAST THEY GOT BANK TO ME."
"Maybe it works for some people, but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app I have tried! Every time I opened it, therr was a 'feature' blocking my use. The ultimate problem was finding no task delete function."
You can't do almost anything without upgrading to premium.
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it."
There is better google keep than this if you need a free one. You need to pay to use this.
يحتاج بال رايق و معقد مو مثل ما اتوقعت وقت ثاني يمكن احمله
"App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features."
"Just uninstalled it It looks a great app, but one its fundamental features (reminder) was available only in premium mode."
"No easy way to import or export tasks in a non-proprietary, other app (e.g. Google Tasks) compatible format."
"Hi Can you add secondary filter, like currently you provide filter option priority 1, priority 2 etc. When we r using a filtered view like ""View all"" then all task priority 1 (from different projects) gets lined up sequentially. Here if suppose 15 task have Priority 1, 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort. Can you please add secondary priority filter like SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view. Any timeline to add this feature?"
Full power app! Sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own. Otherwise amazing.
"I saw this recommended and tried it. I really like the look of the app's widget. Some of the stuff is free and some is premium. I reviewed bout five task apps, and this came down to the finals but I don't want one of the features I need being behind a subscription. So I will be choosing something I can only pay once. Thanks for allowing trying this app!"
"For the love of god explain me why there's no option to always show the tasks I've done??? I don't want to go to the main tab to the submenu, like WHY can't I reach today's ""done"" tasks from today tab??? And no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done."
There's no repeat task daily feature
When I open a project then click on the arrow drop-down the app closest otherwise I normally love the app.
"Last update introduced a bug that crashes the app when opening sub task menus. Don't you guys do some bug fixing before updates? Another problem are the bad apps for Windows, be it the old (abandoned?) or the new Windows 10 one. They are just too buggy and unreliable."
"Todoist is great, no questions about it. Well built, nicely designed, regularly updated. I've been a premium user since Wunderlist was on the chopping block. However, I realized I'm paying $36 each year for essentially one feature: task reminders. Additionally, 2 users in 1 household on 1 budget pay 100% more for both to use the app. I think that's ridiculous so I'm out."
"It costs an arm and a leg, unfortunately"
"The app used to work fine for me until a few months ago I no longer get any notifications. I've fiddled with Android notification settings, app settings, reinstalling, and so on, but nothing worked. I'm able to fire a 'preview' from the app, but it doesn't come in on the time scheduled. Hopefully an isolated issue, but I can't rely on this at all anymore."
I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom.
It won't notify me
"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text"
It felt like too much
"Can you fix the bug where when adding a task, the keyboard fills up past the options that lets you select priority and projects? It's not critical but it's annoying to see at a UX level"
The free tier is close to useless and coming from Ticktick I found Todoist pricier and work fewer features.
App is great as a Wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money? It is not possible. Unfortunately i won't use this app.
How can I stop it from sending me the things I enter the app to my email?😐
"the app is functional and the widget is very handy but the subscription model cost feels a bit much for all of the use I get out of it. I'd be much happier if it was a bit cheaper and when you consider some of the other free options that are out there, paying so much for so little feels like a bit of a con."
Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help. When an alert comes up I would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options. Not one snooze length for.all alerts.
App crashes whenever I try to edit time of any task.
"Suddenly the filter ""no time"" no longer works. It used to work up to yesterday, but no longer does. Please fix."
"Hey folks, it's an app I've heard lot of great things about, but it's not opening for me! I'm on Redmi note 8 pro. Can you please look into it? Thanks! I'll change the review as soon as it works. Best of luck!"
OK... I waited a long time for this app to run in landscape mode on my Tablet. No dice reducing to 3 starts until this functionality is added. Sorry but I can't use this app 50% of the time. thanks
How to add everydays task
"I love the App. However, I recently renewed my phone in China and I need a version that will run without Google play services. - Please make something available so that I may continue to enjoy Todoist"
Why aren't reminders free >:'(
When we add sub-task it gets added too slow!
"While adding time to a Task asked me to subscribe for premium 😂 I said sorry, uninstalling. I can pay for an app for extra features but if I am expected to pay just for basic functionality then plz make it a paid app at the first place."
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet."
No integration with Google assistant. Will probably leave for more integration of hands free control.
"Very good at what it does, but doesn't come close to warranting a monthly charge."
"Does not integrate with outlook. Premium version require annual fee, with only cosmetic added tools. Can live with the free version but looking out for better app that syncs with outlook. now can sync with GTasks but require 'integration' app by 3rd party (pay thru the nose eg. $15/mth). would be good to have 2 way sync, for users to leverage on both apps (using premium subscription of Todoist)"
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"Some functions are frustrating. I was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a, b, or c, but it always changed anything with a part ""a"" to a time. If I manually changed it so there was no time, it deleted the rest of the text."
"Wunderlist was Waaay better. Too bad that one got bought out. I need an app that syncs to another phone, and that let's me organize things the way I need them. This app is okay, but they reserve a lot of features for the paid version (subscription required). Not gonna happen. I've used this app for several months, but I'm done."
"It's good, but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view, and that's my favorite view because I want todoist to be my weekly planner. If I have to click into the app, click the side bar, and then click into the calendar view, it's too much work. Those three views (today, calendar view, etc) I would like clickable like at the bottom always, or the ability to swipe between the views."
NC
"Looks great but no option to save to SD card, and I need phone space, so have to uninstall."
Its a nice app but to keep in mind your tasks it needs a notification but u have to pay for it thats what I hate in this app .coz it doesn't remind u that at what time u have to do a task it gets a little boring while this . sometimes I forget about my tasks
"good application, the free version is very limited since most of the functionality is in the payed version."
"The mobile version is great, but is there a reason that the web interface is suddenly so slow and unwieldy? It's been a few weeks now, so I'm deleting this app and creating lists on a new app, in case anyone has any recommendations."
not that great
"Just learning, I'll check back later."
"Clean, simple interface."
"Paid version probably is good, but.... free version is seriously restricted. Does not live up to reviews, which I am now guessing are mostly premium users. A simple example, reminders cost. 4 colors included, but a simple other one costs. Etc"
"Smart scheduling feature was nice. I miss it a lot. I was using it for a very long time, and I don't think it's OK just to remove a feature without giving something similar."
"Good app. I used it quite a bit, until the version changed and became incompatible with my phone."
Reminders and some other features should have been free.
"Touch & go, plus Google Assistant stated: it's not support with devise (integration). I'm using a Android phone and have the app on it."
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go."
Базовый функционал платный.
Not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit
"Update: thanks but still doesn't help - could it be phone? On Huawei mate 10. First review: Coming from wunderlist, main use shared shopping and admin lists with family, so have shopping project with sub project for each shop. I made the Shopping project the home screen, but can't see any sub projects and their tasks on Android! Can on Mac. Investigating Sections. So multiple taps hunting for undated tasks. Too complex for family, frustrating for me. OK otherwise."
"I've paid for the app for a few months, now I see the smart reschedule feature is gone and I don't feel inclined being a paying customer again."
It reminds and keep systematic record of daily work
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium"
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app."
"After I updated the app, the option to smart schedule disappeared, how do I solve it?"
"Well, i thought it's the best in the market as they clearly have 13yrs of experience now but i was wrong. I so wanted to avoid that (Ticktick) app but there's no alternate to it. Pros - Amazing sync & interface Cons - pricy, no calendar view or sync available within the app (like ticktick), no habit tracker."
I like it
"This is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet, one of the most important things about an online to-do list: a reminder notification, costs money."
"Neither hate it or love it, but I hate apps where I have to have a log in...."
"The concept is good and it's really helpful to have project tabs. However, it's really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear? It makes your progress really difficult to track. Also the subscription price is really expensive! It would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like Nova Launcher. I hope to see these changes made so I can support this app knowing I got my money's worth."
Good
"I liked the app, it was missing a few things but It was okay. I uninstalled it at one point, until I decided if I wanted to keep it, but I am still getting notified for the reminders. It is incredibly annoying and I can't figure out why... Edit: Thanks for the help, the problem is now that I don't know what account I logged in with."
Too many clicks to do things. You need premium version for reminders
Im giving only 3 stars coz remainders are not working inspite doing all the troubleshooting methods posted in todoist help. Help me
Feedback
"Coming from Wunderlist, this is the best one I found. There is one thing which I find irritating. The added item goes to the bottom of the list. Can you add an option to sort by reverse date? That would make it perfect list for me."
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately."
Why too many steps to remove a project?
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.
Charging every task
An app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app
Good
"If I select ""sort by date"" I want it to be automatic. So I do not need to re-sort items if I mark task done or add new task."
"I used to like this app because it was like writing in a physical notebook, but that smooth user experience is gone. I feel like they are focusing too much on adding new stuff while the core functionality gets looked over."
Not bad
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month."
"Pretty good, but too expensive"
Still trying it out
"App has a lot of features, unfortunatelly many not free of charge"
Good
Shouldn't have to pay for reminders.
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that."
"This has been my favorite to do app for years, but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my Note 10. If I don't quickly find a way to resolve this, I'll be looking for another list solution. 🙁"
Reasonably decent to-do list but the yearly fee is too high for what this product actually provides.
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.
More steps to go through to access lists that were immediately available on wunderlist
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us
Mainly making use of tasks. The sub tasks within make my day.
The new widget made the app almost unusable for me. Not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way.
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app."
"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there."
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.
It was essential to me until the last updates.
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards."
Not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget
"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track."
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget. These are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule. The widget could be improved, otherwise the app is great."
"Great app, but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder, it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder. I appreciate that, becouse no one will give you his work as a free. Ok, i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which I need."
I can no longer touch the widget to open the full app. What happened? I use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen.
"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself."
Need notes option like Wunderlist has Get that and you'll get a 5 star I have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please JUST LIKE WUNDERLIST
"needs registration, for online use..."
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking."
"Really great app, but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature: notifications for a timed reminder."
Nice app
"A few major issues: 1. The addition of sections in projects is nice, but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters. 2. The sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list, the can only be at the end of a task list. 3. In filtered view, pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non-completable tasks is ludicrous. Duplicating them like that is silly at best."
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.
Please add app option to put new task at the TOP of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist.
Reminders should be available for all.
New to the app so still learning
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain"
Nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price
Would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it ain't worth it
Useful
Having some problems figuring out what all this app offers; still learning it.
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist."
"Eu amo este aplicativo e uso sincronizado com o meu google calendar. Porem de um tempo para cá, mesmo com a configuraçao para manter no google calendar as tarefas ja executadas no todolist, o evento do google calendar some. Podem verificar? Era muito importante pra mim que os eventos continuassem no google calendar. Minha versao nao é premium e estava pensando em comprar. Estou com medo de comprar e continuar assim. Obrigada!"
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked
Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.
"Have been having issues since last update, when adding a to do, it defaults to go to the inbox folder, instead of going right to 'today' list. So have been forgetting to do stuff because I didn't see it lol. 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed. EDIT: Sane thing happens when I am on today tab and have it set as homepage ."
"Layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm, reminder etc are available only in premium version."
"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly."
I wish more options be available to free version
App is good to use but it's premium so Not using now.
Great way to start to get organized!
"Decent app, but not worthy of monthly fees. What happened to 1x Pro licenses?"
Frustrating update plans.
There is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless I know the smart commands.
"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3."
👍
"It's good, but I don't like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive I am... But that's just me! Nothing against the program"
Keeps me focused!! But I don't want to purchase anything. I think it could all be free in my opinion.
"Google should make an app like this, it's Calendar app is not intuitive like this, giving this app low partly becuz of no integration"
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled."
Great app
"the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great"
"A good app, although disappointed that I can't repeat a reminder without paying"
Please provide undo and redo for all actions
Phone: Samsung Galaxy J7 Star I just started using the app. I'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly.
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek."
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly."
Good
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works."
"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone."
Not user friendly. Free version very limited.
Will this be available for computers soon?
Excellent
"It's a great app. Thank you. I wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task I list, so I could calculate how much I need to invest, also it would be nice if I could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary."
"Уведомления не приходят. Вроде для уведомлений использует push через Google services, но если запретить Todoist работать в фоне, уведомления не приходят. Другие программы: Telegram, Календарь, почта... в тех же условиях работают отлично."
"Fine app But still not install Due to hard working of todoist team, i give good rating"
Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.
"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version"
"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position."
It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications
This app helps me alot in tracking and managing my different jobs.
This is really helping me be organized.
Me esta gustando el sistema que usa
Simple and intuitive
The last update is a win! The new karma & productivity interface are top notch! Keep improving this already awesome app for eventually reaching the perfection! Update: Love the new black theme! This thing is beautiful! Keep it up!
Good view and easy to use
"It almost perfect, it is missing a selection tool, where you can select more than task and delete them at once, also there is no way I can turn a normal task to a sub task to other normal task"
"This is a really helpful app for personal use. I like just having basic to do lists for each day. I would like a better calendar view though, so I could use it instead of Google calendar. I am trying to build habits and routines, and this app is good for setting recurring tasks."
"Pretty good app, but crashes sometimes if you do something unexpected EDIT:contacted you with a crash description"
Intuitive and easy to use
It's a gr8 app. Very useful for daily planners. But i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner.
"The best to-do app I have used for quite some time. It's intuitive, has lots of functionality and is as simple or as complex as you need it to be. You do need to opt for the Premium subscription to get the most out of it but the free version is still one of the best out there."
Helps keep your day on track
Its really good. But is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like Google calendar
Amazing!
"This is a great tool to keep track of task lists. I like that it is available on Android and Ubuntu. It is fast, stable and easy to use. I'm reading Atomic Habits and plan to use the tool to track all my tasks. No more google calendar or written to do lists!"
Really love the app. As it keep me on time and improved my productivity too.
It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.
Good for tasks.
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.
Simple. Intuitive. Effective.
Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.
"Really helps productivity, the email prompts and alerts are a little annoying but really helpful application which keeps my life organised love the link to Google calendar"
I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.
[Review update] It's a good thing I put my subscription renewal date in Todoist as a task because they don't send you any notification that your subscription is running out.
"Im in love with this app! However, being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband's device for just notification feels a little bit wrong. I think for something like a to-do list notification should not be a premium feature. There is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and I have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite. It is so clean, simple, easy to use, and it does recurring todos"
The date search doesn't work in Chinese. It understand Chinese date in a wrong way.
Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.
"Хорошее приложение. Есть подзадачи, а время и дату напоминалке можно указывать текстом. Например, ""завтра в 20"""
"The newest version is great, love the new boards feature"
"I dislike that I must pay to use comments, and I dislike that there is no way to add a description to the task. I understand that in regards to the former that you need to make money, but the latter issue makes it clunky if one has a long and complicated task with resources one must past links to in. But I do appreciate the app and am impressed with how consistently you stay on top of squashing bugs. Keep it up! Can't wait to see kanban implemented!"
Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.
Pretty good so far
The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.
It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick
good if u are a to do list person
"Almost perfect. With a lot on my mind and a million projects up in the air, Todoist does almost everything I need it to do. It's the best option out there so far, but I wish I could use it as my ONLY to do app. Would need the ability to: NOT have completed tasks move to the bottom of their section, but stay in their original order; have new tasks appear at the TOP of the Inbox list; toggle to swipe-only to complete (accidental checking :(); see a percent complete number or visual for proj/sect."
Okey
"Simple, helpful and very neat."
It's lived up to what it say it would do
"Free version has some limitations, but great productivity app so far--longest I've kept one going on the phone yet...!"
I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though
Its better to put more options for notifications Actually the best notifiaction options is for samsung reminder
"It would be great if you can set an estimated time for every activity, but it's great!"
Make it easier to learn how to use it.
I like it but I do wish they could have alarms or reminders or something
Making a list is not something I find easy. But ToDoist is making it happen.
Best app ever! But we cant resort task from widget 😕 plz add this feature tnx alot❤
"Task sections with a ""/” in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me."
Works great!
"Amazing app. Definitely my to do app of choice. Wish it had a more robust Calander view, with a proper week view function. It's also increasingly hard to justify the premium, when free equivalents are getting so much better (Google's, apple, microsoft's), and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists (notion). A big gripe for me is that its design & UI is falling a little behind its competitors (things 3, apple reminders); which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app."
Pretty cool app the best for to list or management I've ever used.
Better than all the other dozen other similar apps I've tried.
Good list app. Simple to use.
So far good. Need to check for add-ons
It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks
It was a gud experience and I found it useful to plan my exam schedule priorities.
Enjoying offloading from my head and the app telling me what I've scheduled from the day. Great for busy minds
not perfect but so far my favorite to do app
Keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project. This app will definitely help you in all the ways it can. Great for increasing productivity.
"Pretty cool, like a lot, has helped me very much"
"This app IS great, and has the potential to be greater! However, my only 2 requests is when you add a ""Parent Project"" to your ""Favorites,"" please include the projects within it as well! And to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple, and reliable. Thanks!"
I appreciate the reminders!
"Great App. Well organized and User friendly UI. Although, monthly subscription is a bit much, I'd rather pay full price for the whole app and get all the features it offers."
Found usefull
I'd like to see a list of the tasks I've done in the last 30 days.
Add pomodoro timer
"Why can't I see completed tasks in any project? Sometimes the program shows them, sometimes doesn't."
"Well designed app, just wish it had some more flexibility for assigning dates and responsibilities. I also haven't been very successful at using the notification function."
Great but could use more assistance features to help automate your task management
Helps me reminder the important tasks to do.
I am still testing it efficiency.
Awesome to do and project management would revommend also i hope to get the premium soon!
420/420 amazing app that beats my lame ass planner
A really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it.
"Enjoying the app, but can't figure out how to get it on my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Whenever I try to find the app for it, I get directed to the phone app."
Reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly.
Free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done.
So far this app has been very helpful. I will be trying out the premium version very soon. Once I do I will update this review.
"Easy to program, not bad at all"
The handling is very fast and intuitive.
Works great
Enjoying it so far. I just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so I get no notifications for my to-do list and I need to open the app to check I need to do.
Nice app to keep me Focused!
So helpful tool.
It's fantastic! But I took a star off because they nagged me to rate it.
Eu gosto muito do aplicativo. A minha sugestão seria para ter a opção de não excluir as tarefas concluídas porque psicologicamente falando dá uma satisfação chegar ao fim do dia e ver todas as tarefas que foram feitas com um risquinho... 😉
Unfortunatelly you must to pay for reminders! :(
"I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is. What I don't like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and EACH time I wanna see them, I have to click on the option to show them. I wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not."
"I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it."
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars."
"Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app."
Ll
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.
Straight forward
Good but a little overwhelming.
"Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none."
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used."
Very nice app! Easy to use.
For now am on love the the app is very very efficient
"Very good but don't see why 1 would pay when Google has Google keep , and calendar works about the Same and is free"
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists
Great app! Keeps up to date
This is a useful tool
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day."
"This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do."
Always a good thing! Great! Wonderful!
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!"
Doesn't link with my calendar or emails
"I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make"
Gd
It's a great organizational tool
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.
Limits lists to 200 items. That was old. It's better now
"This was a solid replacement for wunderlist, but it isn't simply a to do list. It's more of productive tasks"
"Great app, easy to use."
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app
great for use
Makes me productive because I'm always up to a schedule
Easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks.
Great app. Are you going to add the ability to attach images to actions?
It's Good.
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars."
Fun and simple to use
Just using the free version and use Inbox for just a list of things to do.
Pros: Intuitive design Great way to acheive goals Cons: Not entirely free It works with google calendar but each task only can be in 1 hr intervals
Would've been 5 stars if I am able to move around the arrangements of my tasks.
Best for schedule
It helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list.
"Had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects, very clean and easy to use"
"This is a great to-do list app. However, the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here. This app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free. Maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app. Right now, in the free version, you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets, but a reminder should be there even in the basic version."
"Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use. The only problem I have is inability to hide things that are only available with the Premium subscription, such as Labels and Filters tabs, but I understand why they're there..."
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved."
Great product
Really help me to manage my day 👍😊
Easy to use very stable and works well with GTD methodology
Does its job
helps to concentrate 🤪
Easy to use and packed with features
"Realmente es una muy buena aplicación, es fácil ubicarte y organizarte si ya sabes usar este tipo de apps. Lo que encuentro mal es que hay opciones básicas como añadir notas a las tareas que están escritas, y por ellas hay que pagar. Me gustaría que no hubieran tantas opciones de pago o por lo menos no tan esenciales. De resto está muy bien esta aplicación."
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist."
"Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition"
Good
It could be much better if I could see my done tasks and not destroying them...
Easy and practical 👍
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.
Great overall app to get yourself organized
32780 Weather 666IU778 Is a Kitten 27gh with q many different 87878How 1
"So good so far. I give 4 stars just because I didn't use all features yet, so need to go back again to that raiting"
Great so far after a few days free trial.
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.
This is the best. Why I give this 4 star? Because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing
"I think its a great app, although I do have one suggestion. After completing a task, especially for the day, maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there, so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left."
Great for getting reminded of your tasks
Good app that reminds me of my daily tasks
The free version is a bit too limeted. However it does worth it
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!
"Feature request: I hope I can manually reorder tasks in label views like it's done in project views. Of course, to be synchronized across all platforms. This will be cool."
"Great organizer, however, too many features require you to have a paid membership, while similar apps don't require any membership fees."
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :)
"It's okay. Easy to use, just wish incould add a topic/note header toneach individual note."
Wish the free version had more features
"Some issues with sync but so far, I am enjoying it!"
"Great app, wish navigating projects on mobile was easier"
"Mostly great, I just wish I could make my main to do list my home page."
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving."
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.
Easy to use. No dramas. Very streamline for basic list use.
"Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects)"
Very simple and easy to use.
Great for groceries and remembering long-term to-dos
Very nice
It is great
Just getting started on it.
"Overall good, I just wish the alarm feature was available for the free download"
Appreciate this app. It gives me a convenient way to list tasks on the fly!
"Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though."
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.
Loving it...
Easy to use
"Good application, it keep me focused on my goals. One downside is whenever I put a new task on a specific day it doesn't areange it automatically, i have to do this manually"
Is it possible to implement statistics on completing repetitive tasks?
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.
"Easy to use, wish printing lists so they fit on one or 2 pages was possible"
"This app is awesome. I have a sugestion, in the app can't see the projects order by folder, will be good can see by folder"
This app is such high quality in its usage and visual design. It's on par with the quality you'd expect from Google.
"It's revolutionised the way I work as a medical student. Makes going from one task to another effortless, allows me to stick to breaks, etc"
Awesome app. I am enjoying its simplicity and effectiveness.
"Simply brilliant, they put a lot of effort into a quick and smooth user interface (keyboard shortcuts, keywords, date detection) that allow me to implement GTD (almost ;) ) at the speed of my thoughts. Keep up the excellent work!"
Very good!!!
This app is one of the coolest app
"One of the best ToDo apps out there. Started using it as a personal reminder list but the more I learned about the app, the more conveniently it weaved itself into my life. Now it is an important part of my workflow."
Exceptional tool to boost one's productivity. Thanks for this amazing app.
"Been using this app for a couple of years and overall it's been solid. It's not only a life-saver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the ENTIRE app. High quality developments. Seems only natural to have bugs here and there, or else they'd never be able to improve the app's functionality and innovate as a result. Attentive helpful customer support team, devs, AND they provide guides,templates and very helpful tips on their site. Keep it going :)"
Love it!
"2020 update: 4 years later I have upgraded to a premium version, especially after all the newly added features. I've tried many other list/reminder type apps and Todoist stays my favorite. 1st review in 2016: I'm still getting familiar with the app after a week but it seems to be very easy to use. Simple adding items, categorizing them. I'm using the free version."
Good stuff. Helped me realise what a stupid slacker i am. Brb gonna go jump off a cliff now
Best app for to-dos. The highlight is Natural Language Processing.
Great!
Changed my life
Simple but flexible app for managing todo lists and notifications.
"It does what I need when I need it and it provides me with in information I require to be more efficient. Plus it is linked to Alexa so it it easy to add tasks or even groceries to my lust. It's a win, win!"
Great app and it is way better than your regular reminder application. Gonna start using it for my daily life routine
"It remembers my todos, so I can focus on executing those todos. Helps alot in achieving more."
Can you please available the mobile reminder service for free? It's very important for me but I am not able to buy it.
"Awesome app, helping me to boost my productivity everyday."
"Love it! Simple to use, and just the perfect amount of prompting"
Best todo app
Superb.
"The bug's been fixed so i wanted to update the review! Todoist is a really great app; it's slick, it's easy to pick up & use, and it's been essential to me in my day to day life. The date and time input for tasks is super intuitive (ev 10 days/ev 1st & 16th of the mth etc) and I appreciate how easy it is to have tasks loop even with weird intervals. The free version has pretty much everything the average user needs, but I'm sure the features of the paid version will b well worth the price"
Amezing
Extremely useful app!
Very useful. Thanks
"Great app, I'd recommend to anyone that has problem solving, and anxiety issues. It helps me sleep to be able to make todo lists for the next day."
Really helps me get stuff done and on time...
Just became perfect. They listen to customers' feedback. Impressed how they improved all the shortcomings they had before.
It is great app to plan your day. It is easy to use and fast.
Very good
Absolutely amazing app and seriously have nothing bad to say. I wish that we can get more perks as we use the app and its features more to encourage us to mange our time wisely
Basic and nice. I can advice
Nice app
I love the fact that I can create a list of items to do and check them off as I go right here in this app. The notifications are like my own personal secretary. It has helped me tremendously with productivity.
L it is excellent marvelous amazing
Like
Extremely easy to use with excellent visual cues.
Extremely helpful. This app has helped me form new habits and become way more productive.
Love it! Easy project organization and to do list option. The widget for Andriod is AMAZING!
👌✨
"Since last major update, rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled, preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day. Productivity killer."
This app is where I have outsources my brain. My entire life runs on this app and it's so smooth compared to many others. I love how seamless the experience feels between devices
"I have used the premium version of this task manager for several years. Cross-platform functionality is a must and it integrates well with several other programs (email, calendar, IFTTT). Great for those using GTD methodology. Try the free (limited) version, then upgrade for full capabilities."
It's a great app for the one's who don't want to waste their very single moments in this life. It's helpful in achieving goals and to increase productivity in your daily life. Thank you so much to #Doist. Keep moving forward ♥️
The best of the best Plan youe entire life 💜💜💜
Great app to plan your day!
"Very useful, I love it 🥰"
I am new to it but so far an excellent app
This app is so amazingly done and so helpful. I can't begin to describe how much value this app has to me. This app make a huge difference in my life by allowing me to build habits and be consistent with them!!
Helps me member and get so much done
"Todoist is simple, customisable, and helpful app to get things done. Must have app for Productivity."
"Definitely the best app out there for syncing honey-do lists, especially if your life is complicated."
Brilliant App! Been using it every day for over 3 years and I love it.
"Great, clutter free, to the point app with enough features (if you think it doesn't exist, Google it! There's many hidden things you need to know!)"
Excellent and very helpful
Love the sync
"A pretty easy way to keep track of tasks and set reminders, whether recurring or not"
You remind of the todos I had planned to do and didn't do. This keeps me updated. Love it
Helps me cope with my preoccupied life
Love it. Feel less stressed and more organised lately.
Best todo app ever
Extremely helpful at helping me keep track of all the task I need to get throughout the day.
It's very easy to add tasks with its incredible Natural Language Processing.
"Most clear and useful app out there. Tried many, keeping todoist ❤️"
Superb app! fulfilling more than expected
Just amazing. I just want an option to set the list in order that i prefer even if I set them by !!1 !!2 !!3 or !!4.
"Perfect for daily use. Don't look further, this is your planning app"
Perfect and awesome
it was easy to use and very helpful to put my to-do in a digital form
Love this app!
I love it
Android has very few todo/reminder apps that are even worth downloading. This app is an exception and definitely worth the download.
Excellent App.
Very user friendly. nice UX job.
Awesome app. A request to the devs: I wish there was some way o take notes in this app that is linked with a task. So it will be better for future reminders.
"Best to do list tool. I have 30 things to do every day but this app keeps me in line and I meet my deadlines. Between remote work, homeschooling, running errands and holiday shopping, this is so useful. I even have it on my laptop so the team who created this...thank you!"
A fantastic app for trying to manage your life and time.. yet still fail. But the app actually makes me remember that I have something to do. But still.. I won't do it.. for.. reasons.
A real help to get up to speed with remembering task of new job.
"Awesome, saves so much time and effort"
This app is a big help for me in my Work-Study-Life Management.
Good
"A literally effecient app to plan daily & shleduled tasks, goals as well as projects. Easy & user friendly UI. Whether user just wants to note some random tasks or very specific scheduled tasks & projects; it's useful."
The best customer experience I had in 12 years.
Super useful app!
The free version is pretty easy sofar
"Update: As a big user of sub-projects, I was disappointed to see their usefulness go when they no longer appeared in the main project. However, I have recently been pleased to notice the new ""Sections"" feature now allows me to replicate that functionality, and being able to display them a board is a nice touch. I also appreciate how the functionality of the Wear OS app has come along when other developers have been dropping watch support."
UPDATE: Thank you for the fantastic updates on this product! I've moved completely to Todoist now and greatly appreciate the support community. Recommend subscribing to Carl Pullin's YouTube channel to learn all kinds of goodness with using Todoist. Use for GTD. Capture is excellent! Processing and Organizing are easy. Still working on review discipline.
"This app has blown me away! Rarely if ever rate an app, but there are no ads, and the free version is still incredibly highly functional... Just so impressed- well done to the team!"
Great
"Es útil para tener todas mis tareas pendientes, además funciona bastante bien."
My organisation skills have never been as good before I used this app. Its on all my devices. Makes sure every day of the year is not wasted
On the free version. Very intuitive and has made a difference to my organisation. Thank you!
"Satisfying, concise and helpful in organizing my workload accordingly. I recommended this app to many people, it's definitely worth installing."
The best organizational tool on my phonesv
"Great, simple app for managing daily tasks. Keeps your tasks in sync on all devices."
"Just think of this app as your brain 🧠 🤣Anything you think of put it in the inbox. This is your RAM( Random access memory ) power. No storage required, give ur brain the much needed space 🙌🏽. Take a look at YouTube video tutorials. There are a lot of people using this app with really good setups. Definitely set this using ur computer. I believe this is the only way to link ur calendar. Gmail has the best integration."
"Love it. It's simple, but just the thing I need to keep my to-do list written down and handy for easy access."
Excellent program and several YouTube videos to better understand the use of the software.
Very functional and satisfying to use! On an Oppo phone.
Imposter
Excellent Task Management 👍👍
Bom
Very Good!
I'm really enjoying this app. It's helping me juggle between planning my cross-country move and daily life
Easy to use and can integrate with other apps
Can't imagine living without it 😅😅
Good
I've used several and this is the best I've used. Clean interface and every feature I want.
It could really help me to be more well organized
I really love this app.it helps me focus on my study
Good
Used this app to get away from physical to do lists I had scattered everywhere. Works great and I appreciate the ability to really organize my lists!
It helps me be more efficient!
Great app helps plan my day and give me foresight into what's coming up
"I love this app, *but* with the disclaimer that I don't like how it syncs with google calendar. When I synced it, ALL of my todoist entries showed up as calendar events, making it impossible to use my calendar. And, I couldn't un-sync it. So I ended up having to completely delete that todoist account and make a new one with a different email. That was some time ago (two years?) So it's possible the sync function is improved."
Like the fact that Desktop and App syns automatically
Excellent application
"I love it SO much! It's skyrocketed my productivity level & my focus, it's easy to use, & the features in premium are so worth it- thank you to the Todoist Team!!"
Love the product. Keeps my life on track.
Great experience.
Sync across devices easily and quickly. Easy to create lists and love the layout
This is the best to-do list app. Much better than Google or Microsoft alternatives.
"I love how easy it is to add items, and that they sync across platforms and devices Also, that I can add them to /through Alexa"
Very good experience with todoist
Perfect software for actio items management
🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘
Great app
To focus on studying with this app is a brilliant idea cause it reminds you to do homework even more strictly than your teachers. A must-have app
Enjoying the process to choose what is essential.
Very effective way to plan and execute the day to day activities.
I looooove this app i really recomend it its easy to use and it reminds you
Very good. It's worth using properly. Take a little time to learn everything about it and you will find that you have more time and less stress.
Its perfect for student's like me who take every day as challenge and tend to forget what's important each day.
Great!
For a disorganized person -me- this is a big help and pretty easy to use
Excellent and very straightforward and easy to use especially now Boards (kanban-style) are here. As I am very spatially-oriented this is ideal for me.
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it."
"Nice app, useful and easy to use. The free version has lots of options to serve the goal."
Very useful. It helps keep track of productivity very well.
"I have found this app AWESOME so far! It really helps to remain organized! Just 1 hard suggestion, if possible, please add facility for completing periodic goals, like what i am working, is for betterment of my carrier in coming 5 years. Thanks a lot once again!"
Wonderful app! Really helps me to work on what's important!
Perfect
Good app... helps to check each activity on hand.
It's a great app.... love it
I love the feeling of ticking off things I've purposes to do and actually accomplished at the end of the day and todoist aids in that great sense of accomplishment. Super grateful
Maybe I'll get around to using it!
Best productivity tool ever
Excellent app. Very easy to use!
"Powerful, convenient and intuitive"
Worth it. Simple Elegant Useful
"This is beyond helpful when planning out my day. I use this for both school and personal projects. It's aesthetic, organized, and simple to use. I'm in love with Todoist! 💛"
Love it! Nice way to stay organized
By far the absolute best to-do app! The free version is great and the paid version is even greater!
Awesome experience 👏
This app changed my life. Nice overlay.
Very usefull app for procrastinators
Still learning how to integrate this app to my workflow.
Goods App
Very versatile and easy to use
Been using this app for 3 years.
"Best app to manage your to do list, and its syncing feature b/w laptop & mobile is amazing..."
This is beginning to change my life.
The best option for productivity. Use this tool with GTD system and see the magic.
Intuitive and very helpful 👌
Very user friendly
"If you work it, it will work for you."
"It is a great productivity tool, keeps you on track with everything you set out to do"
Best todo list I have used so far. Works on every device I have just perfect ❤️
I've tried to use to-do list type applications before. I see the benefit in them. But they never really stuck with me. The customization and organization options in this app make it great. I use it daily.
The new board view is a nice improvement.
Great
Great reminders
Awsome! Love that google assistant take my voice notes to todoist!
Great so far
"Loving it so far. The absolute high that I get from checking off important tasks on a to-do list is indescribable. Todoist is my white rabbit. But actually it really is great. Feels intuitive. Other than an occasional crash when I move tasks to different sections, causing me to reopen it once again, I really enjoy using it."
Great app to keep on top of life!
Great for basic lists to project management!
I love the app
"**Second Update, Sep 2020** A solid choice 👍 Have been using Todoist for about 5 years. They are like a very slow 🐢 (in terms of releasing features) that you love and hate at the same time, but at the end of the day, this is a super powerful tool that has passed the test of time. Highly recommend."
Amazing tool to organize your day.
Great app.
Great app
"One of the best apps I used in my whole life. Superb, thoughtful, subtle design makes you want to use it, and this is the key!"
I'm enjoying a lot my experience with todoist. My productivity is increasing.
I love it
This app is fantastic! It is so easy to use and has a sleek dashboard that makes it easy to follow up on my own tasks. Free version is great and has all the features I need.
Superb
The perfect to do app.
Awesome
Absolutely love this App! Especially it's support for markdown 😉
Phenomenal
"This app is making me manage better! I love it, specially when I use it on different platforms and web. I definitely suggest it to my friends."
I like the app so far. Good game changer.
cool app
Honestly the best app I could ask for. Managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.
Good
"Greedy app...Not worth the cost, atleast can make it a one time purchase. You can install Google Calendar, tasks ,habit tracker seperately for free and still use it"
"Wanted to try it out but the features I wanted (pomo, monthly calendar view, etc.) are only available with a subscription. Wish I discovered that before syncing google calendar info."
"Used to be a good app, now it's all buggy..."
Pointless to have an account if you cannot have a task that lasts two days without paying for premium. Pomodoro is also premium.
"Crashes my phone everytime a notification pops up to ask if I did a task. Shame because I like feature of building a habit but they can't even get this one feature right. This is just a guess but I believe it's because of the second pop-up after you hit ""yes"" to rate your mood. Pretty useless additional feature."
Not advisable and reliable. highly complicated.
Love ticktick but the lag on the latest version of the mobile app is unbearable.
I paid so much......can you remove the subtask...is annoying...lagging..hang...not the best anymore...extremely dissapointed....worse and worse...please..please...do a new update...
I PAID FOR THIS YESTERDAY AND I GOT MY PREMIUM ONLY FOR ONE DAY??? TODAY I'M NOT PREMIUM AGAIN?? I had enough disappointment because my 2nd device didn't get premium after I PAID and now my first device also like this??? I emailed you since yesterday and also write on feedback on app but I got NO REPLY!!!
"WARNING : steals data, Routes info to chinese servers before uploading to your cloud account. Check via NRF or Pocket SSL capture app. The good: simplistic UI, one may or may not like this. The bad: Google+ authentication is buggy, had to it thrice. The ugly: doesn't allow one to export/import data."
"For a higher rating, pls don't force a response after a long hard day Also need more flexibility, or instructions, in opening, closing, deleting, ending..., i.e., managing tasks"
"I paid for two account on two different device, but at second device, my premium membership can't be used. I paid twice. But I only get one premium account!!!!!"
I am a premium subscriber for 2 months. I billed for October but my premium expired. And app support is not replying to my emails
So much features require to pay to use! Evil money hungry developer.
Garbage
"Often freezing and crashing when I wanna add photos to task, help or give my my money back !!! No support response Tasks in calendar, easy prioritization, only usefull app in shop"
"If you're trying to build schedule it's a pain on ticktick, choose another app, -recurring tasks all move together when postponing one task -When editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks, instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking. - when creating a recurring task I should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day, instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day"
How do you sync? This is next to worthless unless you can sync.
"I used to love TickTick for the combination of to do list and time tracking features. I upgraded to the yearly premium service a couple of months ago. About a week ago, the app started crashing and now won't open at all. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling a couple of times with not change. I contacted TickTick through the app and by email and have gotten no response. I use my to do list for everything and can't have service issues like this. Will not be renewing. Looking for a replacement."
I don't get a completion sound when I finish a Pomodoro
"Decent amount of functions, and I really like the widget for this app, but the free version is too limited to be useful. I would pay money for this app if it was for sale. But I am never going to pay for a subscription to a phone app, especially not a todo list app."
"I love this app but the sync stoped working. If I write list items on my phone (oneplus 6 - android 10) and after I open my desktop (win10) client than my phone sync to my pc. This leads that all my notes dissapire. I am coming from google notes, there the sync is nearly instantly, back and forth. I love to see this core function to be fixed as many others noted earlier. I also ""locked"" the app in the backgound tasks, and reinstalled. No succes for me. I will give 5* if this problem is solved."
"Need the calendar view, but I'm not paying ongoing fees for it. Not enough tasks in the free version, account deleted. Shame."
Worst app
"This was a great app but keep making changes that make it worse. For example you used to be able to merge two tasks together, but now doing so just makes one task a subtask of the other, it doesn't actually merge them into one task and there doesn't seem to be a way around it. Edit - Also if you edit tasks on the web version (which is a quicker way of working around some of the apps flaws) it doesn't seem to synchronize with the Android app, I now have a real mess of old and new tasks"
"I wasted ₹1390/- hard earned money. Microsoft To do, is far better."
"~$30 bucks per year, y'all have lost your minds. Uninstalled"
"This app never gets better no matter how I wait for improvements. One is it late notifications of your to do list. Now, it's always frozen, kindof dead or something. It great app but I'm not using this again."
"I used to love ticktick. I have it on mobile Android and Windows 10 client. They used to sync beautifully. Around 23 Aug, the desktop client and mobile stopped syncing and acted like two separate accounts. In desperation, i reinstalled desktop client. I couldn't log into client nor thru browser. It complained of network configuration and proxies. i don't use proxies. I can log into any account online except ticktick. The help rep is unresponsive. Super disappointed. I'm on premium. I want refund"
"Installed this app, added the tasks, logged in using google in the same order. But after login the tasks added no more found. This is definitely unacceptable."
concept is ok but I dont like ui it make me think a lot maybe the design is very clean
Did not do what it said that it was going to do.
I couldn't use this app... cause payment method isn't available.... it would be great if you add some more payment options like bkash...
Useless without a paid subscription. Not even a weekly view is possible.
"Many of options are in upgrade mode, so i couldn't use them"
"The features of the app is pretty simple and cute, so.. when it comes to the design it's okay! But.. that's not the purpose of the app, it's a reminder! And it never worked, oh! It does! At the first and last time! 😑 And it never works again! The storage of my phone had been wasted! 😒"
"When I try to complete my habits or swipe them away in the notification center, my entire phone freezes up for a few seconds. Other than that, its perfect."
"I wanted an app for easily sharing grocery shopping lists with my partner. I shared the list with her, nothing came through and the app told me to upgrade to premium. No thanks - will pass."
"The tasks don't show when I go to a particular date such as the next day. It says ""you have a free day"" even though all my tasks are set to daily( what is the difference between 'Daily' and 'Every Day' anyway?) I would also appreciate if the subtasks completely checked off once completed instead of showing the next date unlike the other tasks in the list. I thought that I'd found the app with all the features I need and was considering to go Premium but this has really frustrated me."
"Was great till they added fermium garbage limits, and way overpriced premium with crazy overkill features. Got to love the apology to a review. It's amazing how far companies will go to not make a sale or a dime. 👋 I happily pay for services to store data or provide entertainment and apps that provide tools, but wow you must have some super users to garner 30/yr in value from a task app. I'd have been happy with ads or paying $10 once to get some small set of advanced features, but damn."
Complicated mess
To view your calendar you have to sign up & then after you sign up it say you have to upgrade & by upgrade they mean buy it for a month subscription or pay for a year. 😅 Can't really use it for it's intended purpose without having to buy it. I downloaded it because I was under the assumption that it's basic functioning was free. The subscription price is cheap but I'm careful which places I put my bank/card info as I don't feel comfortable putting any info about myself out there.
Lost all my Gnotes information with no advanced warning. Years of important information all disappeared now call tick tick with no integration. Very poor and has caused huge problems
For task duration you need premium
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for multiple months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice. Stop adding features and fix this already
Terrible support. I purchased the yearly suscription and I got no answer using the Feedback & Suggestion from the app and neither using mail to get a refund. Scam.
چطوری باید باهاش کار کنیم؟
"I loved this app. I used it every day. But suddenly it won't share attachments! I get emails with pdf documents attached, and I used to open the pdf and share it with Tick Tick, and the app would be so awesome it would create a new todo with the pdf attached to it. Now not only does the app look different, which is fine, but I can no longer share the pdf files from my email to the app. That was the whole point of using it for me. I'm really unhappy. I also sent feedback through the app."
When will Gant view come?
Fewer integration with Google Account
"App cannot sync in backround so it does not sync with your tasks created for example on your PC until you open it manually sync it. Very annoying feature and also making your tasks ureliable... Too bad, because otherwise it's perfect... P.S. I already has contacted the support, they sent me automatic reply and nothing has happened since..."
Good app
"App is good, however, customer support is not that much. I have contacted them 3 times about an issue and the request is being ignored. I am really sorry that I have to give a low evaluation in order to finally get the attention of the customer support. I am a paying customer for 3 years now"
Asks me to upgrade just to be able to connect to Google task calendar. Uninstall.
"Provided apk installed, looks a bit better, but still has some delay after click on Complete from push notification. UPD4: no tasks duplication anymore. Delay between click on Complete and task movement to completed tasks list still occurs. Same delay happens when I mark task checkbox fron the tasks list, not only from push. When I snooze task, no such delay at all. UPD5: app hangs on switch betw. tomorrow and today. I have not enough spaces to describe cases there, may you share issue tracker?"
Nice
So bad i wish it blocked
"Has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all, yet still put the recurrence on for the day after. I have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so I took my medication too early, fortunately no harm done to me. Uninstalled."
It was on my phone when I bought it. I have no interest in a trash app like this.
"My experience is the exact same as Theodore's review below. Constant syncing problems with google making the app completely unusable. Started happening around the same date as well (around July 25 2020). I emailed the support team with a description and screen shots of the problem and still haven't received a reply. TickTick USED to be a great app but has progressively gotten worse, and now unusable. That's okay though, I've had to switch back to Todoist because of these issues."
Can't import without signing up. I don't want to give up privacy!
38/year y'all out your damn minds. Can't even view a full month calendar with the free version. Only day and week. Silly devs.
"Worst app for reminder, period. Use google products instead. They will work no matter if you turn on or off the background use. This power hungry good for nothing apps are straight to be ruled out. Well if you don't believe me, give it a try and keep regretting"
"Absolutely refuses to not sync data with Google account. If I try to use a Gmail sign in I HAVE to sync everything with Google. The app will ask 500 times in a row regardless of how many times I hit ""deny"". Makes the entire app totally unusable. Changing emails is a massive pain in the ass if you already have a Google account associated with it. This is absolute garbage."
"I think this is just irritating... Because I just planned my whole day and kept reminders, not even a single reminder came through the whole 24 hours....."
"Poor, practically no functionality available in free version, even day view is restricted. Removing this app from my phone."
Don't trust this. No uninstall information anywhere. Makes it feel scammy.
"Update - the app is from Hong Kong, and after the recent Chinese law I urge anyone to stop using it. 😞 I use to love the app rated it 5 stars previously, But sadly nothing can be done. 😟"
"The in app calendar view doesn't show the tasks I've scheduled. When the devs responded to my 1st play store review, i thought they're going to fix it. But now, even after several updates, it's clear they had not taken my feedback with much seriousness. Uninstalling."
Price not shown before creating an account.
The tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks. I have to find another one ... To do list app This app sucks..
"Further to my previous comment, it looks like app is hanging on syncing. As same behaviour can be duplicated multiple times. First started happening on 7th July. P20 pro andriod 10."
2.70 per month for a to do list app? Are you serious? I would mind an add banner at all and would find it fare I know you guys aren't volunteers but guys don't think that I am as desperate enough as to pay such a fee for to do lists.
Expensive
"Recent update broke sync, battery drain and constant crashing. Sort the basics, before adding fancy features."
Chinese app👎
"I set a reminder since last week. It didn't even ring at the chime of the clock while I observed. It rang post 10min approx, that too when I accessed the app to see what's the fault. Please look into this bug."
"it's China app ,so don't use it if you love your privacy"
"At first oke, unless you don't want to give permission to Google.... Each time you Deny to share you're data, the question simply pops up 10 more times, hoping you click allow. This is pesky!!!"
Too many errors.
The premium version of the app is good....But the free version is useless.. And some school students don't get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country. Every interesting and useful feature arw in premium...
"Subscription based calendar, immediately uninstall it"
"Worst customer care, they can't manage a refund, I'm very disappointed. SCAM"
I bought the full version of gTasks Pro from this company and now it's unavailable. Think twice before buying from them.
I don't like this app because...no protecting from this app..
Reminders doesn't work
I don't like this app
Automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 🤕
"Keeps asking for a rating. OK, here's one."
"I found TickTick not satisfy me, failed to give me alarm on events for a week long testing.. 👎👎👎"
"Guys, This is Chinese origin copy of Wunderlist app which is Free of Cost & here they charge claiming for premium features. Not Worth!!"
Worst
Do not work on time
"This is a bad app. After purchasing a paid subscription, I got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my business.I hardly see the task scheduler, just advertising. A lot of advertising. The authors are too greedy."
It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it
"They double billed me for my premium subscription and wont respond to any refund requests. I have been a premium subscriber for over a year, and changed my payment method from Paypal to Google Play subscription, but ended up being billed twice at my renewal (once through each method). I've reached out to their support email address (4 times), and haven't even gotten a response. This app is a good app, but you cannot trust them with your financial information or expect them to respond to you if you have a problem."
This is the beat app of all !!!!
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.
It just vibrate I never get an alert. It only list the task and vibrate when I open the app. It doesn't alert me...
Problem with login
